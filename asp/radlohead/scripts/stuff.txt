I went on a band trip in 8th grade to Schlitterbahn Waterpark, a water amusement park in New Branfels, Texas.

I play drums in a band called lake trout, that is from b-more. we tour all over the us, and some parts of the world. I used to have lon ass dreadlocks,<br /> so if you see someone  on our site with dreads-thats me about two years ago. I went to school for three yrs<br /> as a jazz commercial performance major but dropped out once the band got going.Oh yeah I play drums. Lessee what else.......<br />I rock at crossword puzzles and I paly in a side proect called big in japan, that plays all improvised live drum and bass.<br /> I am obviously a huge radiohead fan, but I also like-coltrane, elvn jones, nirvana, pixies nick drake, amon tobin, luke vibert, aphex twin<br />thelonius monk, larry young, wayne shorter, godspeed you black emporer, old medeski martin and wood, all the native tongues, clutch<br />bad brains, circle jerks, etc.     Blah blah blah-I dunno if you want to know anything else don't hesitate to ask. for tour dates<br /> and such just go to laketrout.com I love you all...... really.<br />

"in the winter i'm a buddhist; in the summer i'm a nudist"<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />a friend of mine sent me a quote once and it's really <br />changed the way i look at living.  so i thought i should<br />pass it on to others and make them feel happy...as i am,<br />as he has made me.  maybe i'm just being sentimental or <br />maybe i'm just listening to nick drake <br />too much.  well, here it is:<br /><br />"Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. <br /><br />It is our Light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be. <br /><br />You are a child of God; your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. <br /><br />We were born to make manifest the glory of God/the Divine within us. It is not in just some of us. It is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. <br /><br />As we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others." <br />                               <br />Nelson Mandela <br /><br /><br /><br />oh and leave me a message....i love messages!!!  <br />and i will love you forever if you leave me one.<br />thanks.  by the way...hi to alex...cause he's the only one that i know who looks at these profiles.  *mwah*  <br /><br />

"it a hard thing to drive a cake insane, but she had managed it. first shed wanted it to say happy birthday and then nothing and then happy birthday but more elaborately and then happy f**king birthday but that had seemed rather crude. she'd stuck the candles in to form the numbers in his age , but then she thought that might have been daunting, so she took them out andput them in a circle, but didn't really find that aestetically pleasing. and THEN THEN, the audacity of this girl, she claimed the cake wasnt round. that it was lopsided. that clearly one edge was lower than the other. the cake had put up with her sh*t for too long and it just went right off the wall bing bang boom like cakes do and that was that"- elephant shoe<br />

Radiohead is one of my favorite bands, just behind the cure. I've seen them in Paris the 20-09-2000. this was weird but i loved Idioteque which sounds better live i think. For me their best album is The Bends. I prefer songs like Thinking About You,Lurgee,The Bends,High and Dry,Exit Music,Lucky,Kid A,Idioteque and of course The Thief.

For Your Pleasure, I present: 50 PICK UP LINES! Learn them. Love them. Live Them.<br /><br /><br />1) Your body's name must be Visa, because it's everywhere I want to be <br /><br />2) If you were a pair of pants I'd wear you out!!<br /><br />3) Come over to my house and lets do math, subtract the clothes, add the bed, divide the legs, and we'll multiply. <br /><br />4) Thats a nice outfit. It would look great crumpled up on my floor. <br /><br />5) I can't find my puppy, can you help me find him? I think he went into this cheap motel room. <br /><br />6) I lost my teddy bear will you sleep with me? <br /><br />7) Lick your finger and touch the person, touch yourself with it and say, "Let's you and me get out of these wet clothes." <br /><br />8) Can I buy you a drink, or do you just want the money. <br /><br />9) Hi. Are you cute? <br /><br />10) Do you have a map? I just keep on getting lost in your eyes. <br /><br />11) Your lips look so lonely.... Would they like to meet mine? <br /><br />12) Would you touch me so I can tell my friends I've been touched by an angel? <br /><br />13) Can I have a picture? I want Santa Claus to know exactly what to get me for Christmas. <br /><br />14) If stars would fall everytime I would think of you, the sky would soon be empty. <br /><br />15) If looks were against the law you'd be arrested, booked, and jailed for life. <br /><br />16) I can sense that you're a terrific lover, and it intimidates me a little. <br /><br />17) Hello. Cupid called. He says to tell you that he needs my heart back. <br /><br />18) You must be a thief, because you stole my heart from across the room. <br /><br />19) Pinch me... You're so fine I must be dreaming. <br /><br />20) Am I dead, Angel? Cause this must be heaven! <br /><br />21) Ouch! My tooth hurts! ...Because you are sooo sweet! <br /><br />22) If you were a tear in my eye I would not cry for fear of losing you. <br /><br />23) You're like a dictionary, you add meaning to my life! <br /><br />24) Hi, I just wanted to give you the satisfaction of turning me down... go ahead say no. <br /><br />25) Hi, I've been undressing you with my eyes all night long, and think it's time to see if I'm right. <br /><br />26) I seemed to have lost my way, would you mind taking me with you? <br /><br />27) I've got an alarm clock that makes the best sound in the morning. Would you like to come and hear it? <br /><br />28) You know, you might be asked to leave soon. You're making the other women look really bad. <br /><br />29) Baby, if you were words on a piece of paper, you'd be what they call fine print. <br /><br />30) If I told you that you had a great body, would you hold it against me? <br /><br />31) Is it hot in here or is it you? <br /><br />32) I'm new in town... Could you give me directions to your apartment? <br /><br />33) You with all those curves, and me with no brakes !!! <br /><br />34) Do you have a sunburn baby, or are you always this hot? <br /><br />35) Is there an airport nearby or is that just my heart taking off? <br /><br />36) Wanna know what would look good on you.. Me. <br /><br />37) Do you like blueberries or strawberries, because I want to know what kind of pancakes to order in the morning. <br /><br />38) Excuse me, do you have your phone number? I seem to have lost mine... <br /><br />39) Do you sleep on your stomach? ...Can I? <br /><br />40) I'm new in town, could I have directions to your house? <br /><br />41) Are you from Tennessee? You must be... because you're the only ten I see. <br /><br />42) Was you father an alien? Because there's nothing else like you on earth! <br /><br />43) For a moment I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Now I see that I am very much alive, and heaven has been brought to me. <br /><br />44) You are the only reason why I came in here alone. <br /><br />45) Hey I see your wearing clothes, I'm wearing clothes, you know we have something in common we should get together and do something sometime. <br /><br />46) I'll cook you dinner if you cook me breakfast. <br /><br />47) When I saw you from across the room, I passed out cold and hit my head on the floor...so I'm going to need your name and number for insurance reasons. <br /><br />48) Excuse me, I don't want you to think I'm ridiculous or anything, but you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I just felt like I had to tell you." <br /><br />49) Who stole the stars and put them in your eyes? <br /><br />50) Babe, your beauty makes the morning sun look like the dull glimmer of the moon. <br />  <br /> <br />NAMES:<br />cisum tixe THINKIN NAUGHTY!!!!<br />Sexually Excited Cisum Tixe<br />Chef Cisum Tixe<br />Cowgirl Cisum Tixe!...*cracks whip*<br />DENTIST CISUM TIXE<br />(mliF A roF) cisuM tixE	<br />Bartender Cisum Tixe<br />cisum tixe the crazy wench<br />Exit Muzak<br />Kazum Tixe<br />Aruba In A Tuba<br />I LOVE SPRODFISH<br />Mama Butterfly<br />NowWeAreOneInEverLastingPeace  <br />DO YA WANNA<br />Naughty Feather<br />Touch me then try and leave!<br />Sprodfish is my CUNT!!!! ....*giggles*....I don't think he likes that one!..*wink wink*<br />Lady S<br />Miss Dr. FeelGood<br />RAWHIDE<br />Lady Fingers<br />MISBEHAVIN<br />Love Bite<br />Bag Me Baby<br />My dates my brother!<br />Please Me<br />Thigh Hopes<br />Lather Up Lassies!<br />I AM THE GOD OF ORAL SEX!<br />I AM GOD OF BLACKJACK<br />Miss Vagina<br />Century Son is my DADDY!!!!<br />James is my long lost brother!<br />Thoms MANMEAT!!!!......thought up by Boxcar<br />Thoms Tube Steak...also Boxcar<br />Thoms Shaft od Love...and then again, Boxcar!<br />Swoonderful<br />It's Karma<br />scrapin' the rail<br />moon doggie<br />hoola<br />ooh la lift<br />razz ma tazz<br />sweet torte <br />liar lips<br />raisin hell<br />But Officer<br />mug shot<br />Motion Ocean<br />Fantasy Trip<br />Slightly Jaded<br />burnin' rubber<br />moon beam<br />etc...!!!<br /><br />OH DEAR, I think I got a bit carried away with my stuff!!<br />*giggles*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

I am a carbon-based lifeform living on the planet Earth formerly known as the interstellar genetic soup. My serial number is Etienne Blythe and you can email me <a href="mailto:eblythe@mochamail.com"><b>here</b></a>! My two greatest trips are music and visual art.<br><br>Music: specifically progressive-electro-rock, electronica, rock, indi-rock, folk-rock, techno, drum & bass, ambiant, jazz, classical, ska, house and industrial-rock. I also play afew instruments. Not really excelling in one but more like being an average/less-than-average player for many. I play classical guitar, lead guitar bass/contre-bass, tam-tams, TS404s, vocoders, turntables (scratchers), drum synths, boards (keyboards, piano), and various analog synths. I also have a bit of experience playing real drums but I'm not very good at all.<br><br>Visual art: specifially 3D animation and special effects. I love the challenge of using a surealistic concept and making it as realistic as possible. I also like the idea of sci-fi falling-apart worlds to be pretty cool. other forms of art, drawing (pencil, only b&w), photography, landscape art, interface design. And the occasianal structure made out of toothpicks and marshmellows. ;)<br><br>You can visit my website <a href="http://nearworlds.cjb.net"><b>here</b></a>. It has most of my art up, not counting drawings and most photographs, as I don't have a scanner. I also have some of my soundscapes online, you can listen to my noise <a href="http://www.ampcast.com/droolingampfanclub"><b>here</b></a>!<br><br>RHMB rules, because I meet so many like-minded people there!

Communist Bastard is actually just a Useless Bastard who misplaced his original password several years ago.  If this is any indication of just what a big loser he is just wait until you meet him on the message board.  He tends to lurk, suddenly pounce, and then just a quickly run away.  He is undergoing Chemical Therapies to help him continue to live and late at night is know to bitch about how it makes him sick.  He is fanatically devoted to Radiohead as they are his favorite band.  He is also a musician and a first rate musical snob.  So actually he sucks. . .<br />

All you truly need to know: I will ALWAYS be younger, prettier, have more taste, better teeth AND shake a tambourine with far more panache and rhythm than that riot grrrl wannabe Lovepatch, who auditioned for Thonncolphiled by screeching a Bon Jovi "power ballad" from the early 80s. How she got in I'll never know, but I imagine bribery and/or blackmail played a key role. I suppose we need an old member to appeal to the baby boomer demographic. *shrugs* As for the rumour that I'm jealous of Lovepatch's "shaking" ... if I thought that dancing should consist of spastic-like seizures, why then yes! I'd be jealous! :P <br /><br /><br />

The year is 2029. <br />The machines will convince us that they are conscious, that they have their own agenda worthy of our respect. <br />They'll embody human qualities and claim to be human, and we'll believe them <br /><br /><br />Take death for example. A great deal of our effort goes into avoiding it. We make extraordinary efforts to delay it and often consider its intrusion a tragic event. Yet we'd find it hard to live without it. Death gives meaning to our lives. It gives importance and value to time. Time would become meaningless if there were too much of it. If death were indefinitely put off, the human psyche would end up, well, like the gambler in the "Twilight Zone" episode. <br /><br /><br />The STUFF Story...<br /><br /><br />Hey, im Richard, Dickie to some. Ive been a Radiohead fanatic for since late 1997, when i got OK Computer. I got it Christmas Day, and the whole rest of break it was in my house on repeat. Im surprised i didnt drive my parents up the wall. In the following months i purchased Pablo Honey, and The Bends, and most recently Kid A on my nineteenth birthday. I had fallen in love with Radiohead and all their works. Its as if the band and i are on the same wavelength. Their emotions and messages seem to represent my ideologies and how i feel. <br /><br /><br />Its all about ME and JESUS up in here...<br /><br /><br />But anyways, a little over three years after i discovered the greatest band in the world, ive moved out on my own and im attending the University of Florida as a history major. My interests also include listening to music (spaklehorse, pixies, portishead, sigur ros, and the like), watching football and college basketball (go gators!), watching movies (i LOVE fight club), reading (especially something by vonnegut), and jusy going out drinkin heines, smokin weed, and living the good life. Im just a regular guy looking forward to talking with other Radiohead fans.<br /><br /><br />Lock the door, <br />lock the door, <br />lock the door. <br />Lock the door, <br />lock the door, <br />lock the door. <br />Lock the door, <br />lock the door. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/eckies/collage.jpg"></C><br /><br />By means of external stimulation it is possible to change out brain activity and our frame of mind.<br /><br />Sitting in the dark, either in front of the computer or the television, we immerse ourselves in the world outside. Or at least an image of that world. We are bombarded with a montage of images (past, present and future), choices, and information. How much choice do we really have? The information we see has been selected for our eyes, gone through a filter to sift out unnecessary or uninteresting pieces. What really happens out there is a mystery, but we accept the images that we see as the whole truth. We are being controlled by outside forces into believing the things on the evening news are the most important issues right now. Is this the reality we live in, or just a mask of the true world?<br /><br />Historically the first method to influence the performance of the human mind was called biofeedback.<br /><br />"By manufacturing consent, you can overcome the fact that formally a lot of people have the right to vote. We can make it irrelevant because we can manufacture consent and make sure that their choices and attitudes will be structured in such a way that they will always do what we tell them, even if they have a formal way to participate." (Chomsky). The government has its own agendas to carry out, and if at every turn they had to explain their situation and have the public vote on it, it would take months to get any approval. So instead they use the media to manufacture our consent, make us believe in what they do. Limit our options in what to believe. But this is beginning to change. With the Internet the access we now have to such vast amounts of information and the exposure to different ideas and stories gives us new choices. It is our job to "discern the truth in the ground pattern of influence and circumstance" (McLuhan 82). Now that we have a choice in what to believe will we take advantage of it?<br /><br />Theta waves oscillate at the frequency of 4-8 Hertz and prevail while a man is asleep.<br /><br />In the world we live in today we must choose what to believe. As we change each station or go to each website we see a contradiction to the information in the previous. "An ingrained new-media phobia lies at the heart of journalism's anxieties about the digital world" (Katz 35). With all the variations that we see in media coverage it is hard to distinguish whose story is correct, thus we become sceptical of all sources in general. We therefore must be convinced of a network's, a journalist's, or a corporation's integrity, and this requires persuasion, or the changing of ones previous opinions.<br /><br />On the electroencephalograph, the brain waves are divided into alpha, beta, theta, and delta waves.<br /><br />I think about the ways in which the media affects my day-to-day life, how I am being manipulated by corporations, and swayed by journalists. In our society the dollar controls all. Almost everything is a commodity, even down to my attention on a news program; someone gets money because I am watching. Our society is full of vast networks of people, data, corporations, and things, which intertwine and form a global information culture. I wonder about who is in control of my life. Am I in control? Are my thoughts my own, or are they just reflections of what society has imposed upon me? <br />Everything around me is an influence in someway, but when does the media's influence become more? I still have the choice to believe or not believe any information I am exposed to, but when I keep seeing and hearing the same statements and images, it becomes more believable. With this constant repetition my own views are skewed, and eventually forced out of my mind.<br /><br />The beta waves oscillate 14-40 times per second. This means their frequency is 14-40 Hertz. They prevail in the brain activity when a man is concentrated on some task.<br /><br />"The elite media, sometimes called the agenda-setting media because they are the ones with the big resources, they set the framework in which everyone else operates… They can be political managers, business managers (like corporate executives or that sort of thing), doctoral managers (like university professors), or other journalists who are involved in organizing the way people think and look at things" (Chomsky). These elite members of the journalistic society have the ultimate control over us. They set the decisions for what the smaller news operators and networks cover. "The point of that is, if you're an editor of a newspaper in Dayton, Ohio and you don't have the resources to figure out what the news is, or you don't want to think about it anyway, this tells you what the news is. These are the stories for the quarter page that you are going to devote to something other than local affairs or diverting your audience. These are the stories that you put there because that's what the New York Times tells us is what you're supposed to care about tomorrow." (Chomsky). The power that these elite journalists have over smaller news networks filters down to us and into our daily lives. <br />For instance take the case with the Elian Gonzales trials going on now. News stations and papers all have little Elian Gonzales on the cover, but there is so much more going on the country than that. Take the IMF and World Bank protest that are going on at the same time. The media has only shown the violence at the protests and have only portrayed the protesters as some kind of irrational group of anarchists instead of aiming to inform the public about why the protests are taking place and what the IMF is doing that is upsetting so many people. As a substitute the press focuses in on little Elian so as to not draw any negative attention to what is going on in international politics and economics that may make our government's agenda look bad.<br /><br />The alpha waves frequency is 8-13 Hertz and they prevail with the eyes closed when a man is inactive.<br /><br />"The real mass media are basically trying to divert people. Let them do something else, but don't bother us (us being the people who run the show). Let them get interested in professional sports, for example. Let everybody be crazed about professional sports or sex scandals or the personalities and their problems or something like that. Anything, as long as it isn't serious. Of course, the serious stuff is for the big guys. "We" take care of that." (Chomsky). The public for the most part is intentionally shielded from any news the government or the elite don't want us to see. The mistakes they make, the bad decisions, the unflattering portions of our nation's character, all the things that would cause us to question their integrity and power. So are we being protected or just manipulated by the government and a few elites in order to allow them to do their jobs more easily. It is easier for them to do their jobs if we all believe what they are doing is the correct thing, so they merely hide the fact that what they are doing might not be the right thing. We must change our state of mind from blind trust in what we see in the news to one of scepticism, and realize that what we see are just over simplifications and "necessary illusions", which is not the whole picture by any means, but a small sliver cut for us to provide some tolerable sense of reality (Chomsky).<br /><br />…Soon there will be on the market the systems with biofeedback which will make it possible to watch one's dominant brain frequencies on the screen. Those systems will store in their memories thousands of programs enabling the user to get in whatever state of mind and pass all kinds of experiences in the same way as when you are changing channels on TV.<br /><br /> <br /><br />i wrote that and if you have nothing better to do than read it visit the rest of my site.<br /><br /><CENTER><IMG SRC="http://members.tripod.co.uk/eckies/escreen.jpg"></C><br /><br />words are meaningless when the facts are apparent.

My mood is foul today, so I will try to keep this short. I must keep this short, in fact, because I can barely see the page I'm working on. <br /><br /> <br /><br />My left eye is swollen shut, and my mouth is so crooked that I lisp & spit when I talk. My phone rings constantly, but I can't answer it, and football games are meaningless. <br /><br />On Friday (or maybe it was Thursday or Saturday), I was bitten on the cheek by a Brown Recluse spider & my face swelled up like a Blowfish. My eyes are like slits and my nose has disappeared. I am Diss-Figured, in a word, and my sense of humor is cruel. <br /><br />This is an ugly way to live, but at least it has given me time to brood & bitch & fondle my crystal ball for the Meaning of Life in this rotten little year 2001. <br /><br />The rest of the year will be marked by three distinct trends -- or Drifts, or Developments, Plagues, Fads, Fashions & certainly inescapable Realities: LARGE BREASTS, THIN WALLETS and ENORMOUS FEAR of BILL COLLECTORS. These will be the Primary Drive -- energies behind everything else that happens in 2001. This is all Ye know & all Ye need know. <br />

when i put my emotional development on hold, i had not anticipated just how bitter and angry this small neglected part of my personality would become. subjected to 3 clear years of hold music, classical works rendered on a monophonic beeping device punctuated only by a half human voice assuring that "an operator will be with you soon", it swelled into an ego-monster. however, having uncaged it again 2 years ago, i've found that it tends to cower when confronted with beeping, monophonic renditions of classical works. this is why you will find me curled up on the back seat of public transport, my mobile phone ringing endlessly. please do not hate my business suited ass or my mobile ring, it is the only way i can hold it together.<br />

Geoffrey
Never having a comedy presence within the Rainbow cast, Geoffrey was always there to ensure that the mishaps and quarrels of the remaining cast would provide a moral to the viewing public.<br />When misunderstanding reared its ugly head, George, Zippy and Bungle would always be able to rely on Geoffrey for an explanation. What a guy.<br /><br />
##USER##
George
This shy, pink hippo always assisted Bungle in trying to keep Zippy along the straight and narrow. Whenever storytime came, George would partner Zippy in heckling throughout with the phrase:<br />"Wooo!"<br />It might not have helped Geoffrey very much, but it certainly added tension to the story.<br /><br />

written in a kind of haze on a cold tuesday night: i do artwork and stuff, mostly design-related stuff. i take pictures and make drawings and paintings and writings and stuff. i often put stuff into a computer and ask it to make sense of everything. sometimes it does. the rest of the time it just crashes. then i switch it off and do something else instead. i spent far too long at college and i am still suffering withrawal symptoms. i am moving to london early next year. my website should have something on it soon. i cannot find a good picture of myself, so i have included one of the worst.<br /><br />stuff i like: the fresh sea air and brilliant morning light. i adore rain when it really pours and glitters like diamonds in the sunlight. the local featureless coastline is so open and desolate - you can see absolutely nothing for miles - sometimes i like wandering through the golden sand dunes. it looks gorgeous when the tide is in and the sky goes orange. red is my favourite colour. i like black a lot too. i am a hopeless romantic. i love a wonderful girl with beautiful, sparkling eyes. a smile, a glance, uncontrollable laughter. apparently i giggle like a girl.<br /><br />other stuff i like: a lot of art, film, literature and music. some artists, film-makers, writers and musicians: richard hamilton, damien hirst, bridget riley, man ray, mark rothko, andy warhol, jean-luc godard, alfred hitchcock, stanley kubrick, michael powell, francois truffaut, wim wenders, jg ballard, anthony burgess, joseph heller, franz kafka, jack kerouac, george orwell, autechre, bjork, miles davis, billie holiday, pj harvey, pixies. there are many more, but most lists are rather boring.<br /><br />i have far too much 'stuff' - books, records and videos - to remember what there is anymore, and i do not usually make lists. sometimes i lose some of this stuff, but there is always plenty around to keep me amused. yet still i suffer from prolonged spells of boredom. oh, silly me.<br /><br />thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br />thy dial how thy precious minutes waste.<br /><br />i am bad. i deserve punishment.<br /><br />;-D<br />

Stuff?  STUFF?  What the hell's that supposed to mean?  Arent't there supposed to be questions here?  STRUCTURE?  Even just inane questions like "favorite radiohead song" to get the ideas flowing?  Honestly, how can you really tell anything about somebody by how they fill in a box marked "Stuff"?  It makes me sick, I tell you.  Sick.<br><br>That all said<br>I'm a post-senior semi-student at Johns Hopkins.<br>I work a bit in the Admissions Office there, so if anyone's applying to college and wants advice on the process, I'm happy to assist.<br>I play bass and guitar and keyboards.<br>And I am very, VERY single.<br><br>You know, I had a fucking profile up at mel:ittens.  But now that site is dead.  How many more profiles will I need to make?  How long will this stay up?  For the love of god, WHERE WILL ALL THE MADNESS END!?!?!?!<br><br>And no offense to a fine site, but for some reason whenever I try to edit, it changes my 'real name' to my 'board name', and it never loads the image or shows my website.<br><br>So if you want a website with images of yours truly (and who wouldn't), go to http://www.geocities.com/idiotkingd4n/who_am_i.htm<br><br>But really, why bother when there's so much quality hardcore pornography to be had on the cheap here?<br />

Well let me just get this out of the way... Radiohead is the best.  I also like (to a lesser degree) Pulp, Blur, Stone Roses, Radiohead, Bob Marley, Belle and Sebastian (or Sad Bastard, as some people like to refer them as), Sublime, Daft Punk, Radiohead, Me First and The Gimme gimmies (just the name not the music), Rancid, Op Ivy, Social D, Doors, Radiohead, Beatles, Oasis (a teense), Surjit Bindrahkia, and plenty more that slip my mind at 2am.  I don't like 99% of the crap on MTV, or Sacramento radio.<br />     Radiohead concert highlights:  Out of all the Radiohead concerts I've seen (four)... hand's down... Thom's solo of True Love Waits, in Santa Barbara.  Cinnamon Girl (same concert) was a close second.  Note to Thom:  That was much better than the ol' coot could ever do, don't worry about it being anything other than a compliment.  Oh and meeting Tim Roth, Jason Lee, and Rose McGowen (but that had no effect on the amazing show, it was just an added bonus).  Whew!  Poor fingers.<br />

I know everybody likes lists, so here's two (in alphabetical order only):<br /><br />Favourite bands: Alex Lloyd, A Perfect Circle, Augie March, Beth Orton, Björk, Blur, Cat Power, Clinic, Elysian Fields, Gerling, Gomez, Gorillaz, Mr. Bungle, Múm, PJ Harvey, Portishead, Radiohead, Regurgitator, Sigur Rós, Talking Heads, The Beatles, Tool, Travis + a number of others (too many to remember).<br /><br />Favourite Radiohead songs: Bishop's Robes, Bullet Proof.. I Wish I Was, Coke Babies, Fog, High And Dry, How To Disappear Completely, I Can't, Kid A, Let Down, Lift, Like Spinning Plates (Live), Lurgee, Meeting In The Aisle, Million Dollar Question, Morning Bell, Nude (Acoustic), Paranoid Android, Permanent Daylight, Street Spirit (Fade Out), The Amazing Sounds Of Orgy, The Tourist, There There, Worrywort, and about 20 others that stand out just as much.<br /><br />And all subject to move around a bit. Those are usually the ones I'd put on a favourites list, but I do have songs I get into more sometimes.<br />I actually did that list a while ago, so it's due for a change. I just can't be bothered doing it now.<br /><br />Anyway, that's more of a reason to just talk to me properly, and not waste time reading these crappy lists (even though I know you all love them so much). My tastes change and there are too many things that (I) can't be (bothered to) put on here.<br /><br />But it'll probably have to be e-mail, because I've stopped going to the board really. Haven't been in nearly a month. But do feel free to e-mail me if you want to talk.<br />

above photo courtesy of William Blakeney. The synthesizer was used at the famous Grant Avenue Studios during the period that Brian Eno was producing the Apollo Soundtracks and appears in some of those recordings.<br /><br />"Back in 1969 and '70, Moog Music was not yet in the musical instrument business per se. Our modular synthesizers were sold as pieces of professional audio equipment. They were made to order, and we considered them to be too complex and high-tech to survive on the floor of a musical instrument store. Our original concept for the Minimoog was to take some of the basic features of our modular instruments and integrate them into a compact performance synthesizer that could be programmed without patch cords. We imagined that Minimoog customers would consist primarily of studio musicians who wanted a cut-down version of a Moog modular system to take on their gigs.... We figured that we might sell as many as a hundred Minis before it would be time to update the design.<br /><br />"We had no idea of what a small portable synthesizer should look like, so we asked our industrial engineers for some suggestions. They came up with drawings for some very sleek packages indeed -- white sculptured plastic cabinets that suggested computer terminals, gleaming multi-colored panels, and strikingly-shaped controls. We then polled our musician friends to see which designs they liked. We were in for a surprise! Nearly everybody shot down the sculptured plastic in favor of natural wood and simple lines. We simplified one of our designer's concepts to the point where we could actually make the cabinets in our own modest wood shop, then proceeded to create the Minimoog.<br /><br />"The only Minimoog that was put into production is called Model D.... We adapted some of the circuitry (such as the filter section) from the modular instruments, but designed other circuitry (such as the oscillators and contour generators) from scratch. In fact, Moog's first temperature-compensated oscillators were designed for the Minimoog.<br /><br />"...We exhibited the Minimoog at the National Association of Music Merchants convention in June, 1971. It was our first exposure to the music instruments industry - and the industry's first exposure to synthesizers. [Moog's previous synthesizers, the modulars, were marketed to recording studios, audio engineers and schools.] We did not experience a warm reception. Most dealers didn't know what to make of a musical instrument with words like Oscillator Bank and Filter printed on the front panel." ----Bob Moog<br /><br />[excerpted with permission from the book Vintage Synthesizers by Mark Vail, copyright Miller Freeman, Inc]<br /><br />"The Mini-Moog featured three voltage-controlled oscillators, a mixer, noise source, VCA and a warm resonant filter which could be controlled with a dedicated EG called a 'Contour Generator'. The Mini also had an external input which allowed external signals to be processed through the filter, as well as a voltage controlled 'S-Trigger' jack which allowed the Mini to be hooked up to a ribbon controller, sample-and-hold or percussion (drum) controller.<br /><br /><br />"The Mini's control panel could be raised or lowered for ease of use as shown... Most innovative were the wheel-controlled pitch and modulation controller mounted on the left side of the [44-note (F-C)] keyboard, allowing for pitch bend and variation in modulation or vibrato depth."----William Blakeney<br /><br />

I can't think of anything else to put here, so you can put up with this pile of crud again (not that anyone reads my profile):<br /><br />DEAD: Michelle Madden (Age: 18) <br /><br />Michelle Madden, 18, was a college freshman when she became pregnant. Michelle decided to have an abortion after a doctor told her that the drugs she was taking for epilepsy would cause her baby to be deformed. O.B. Evans performed the abortion at the Family Planning Medical Center of Mobile, Ala. Three days after the abortion, Michelle collapsed and had to be taken to the hospital. At the hospital, doctors found a leg bone, two pieces of the baby's skull and some of the placenta inside Michelle's uterus. <br />Michelle died of a blood infection resulting from the abortion three days after admission to the hospital. <br /><br /><br />DEAD: Mary Pena (Age: 43) <br /><br />Mary Pena, a 43 year-old mother of five, died after she underwent a second-trimester abortion at San Vicente Hospital in Los Angeles in December, 1984. When Mary started to bleed severely from the abortion, the surgeon decided to perform a hysterectomy on her. While in recovery from the operations, Mary started to bleed again and went into shock. The surgeon was unable to stop the bleeding, and Mary died on the operating table. <br />According to the autopsy report, Mary bled to death as a result of a cervical laceration, which she suffered during the abortion. The medical examiner noted that Mary's cervix was cut extensively and that the uterus lining had haemorrhaged. According to the medical examiner, the surgeon had cut out almost a pound of Mary's flesh. The body of Mary's 22-week old baby girl, whose head had been cut off, was also found in Mary's uterus. <br /><br />Haven't you got anything better to do with your time?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

The Handbook <br /><br />Rule 1: Everybody gets a shit kicking. Maybe just to ensure that you don't spend the rest of your life thinking you're better than those who get shit-kicked every day of theirs.<br /><br />Rule 2: Morality extends no further than acceptability. You will go as far as you're willing to go. Such distances have never been equal between us. One man's evil is another man's amusement park. <br /> Rule 3: Ignorance belittles those around you more than it does yourself. <br /><br />  Ignorance and the Ebola virus are comparable in three respects:<br />      1] They're both invisible<br />      2] They're both infectious<br />      3] And they both kill <br /><br />Rule 4: Infinity is unimaginable. So imagine reduction. If heaven can be found in the sky's reflection off of calm waters then it's a fucking shame that it's too polluted to swim in.<br /><br />Rule 5: Prisons do not exist without capitulation. Between the bars there is nothing. And if you look close enough you'll realize that there's always more nothing than bars.<br /><br />Rule 6: Time is greater than suffering. Those that we pity in our time will pity us in another.<br /><br />Rule 7: Power begets fools. Fools beget power. Thinking that one can control that which cannot be controlled attracts fools like a magnet. Enough so that, in a short period of time, the epicenter becomes an institution of them.<br /><br />Rule 8: Death is the working class's luxury. Some people take vacations. Others spend their lives working towards a prolonged leave of absence.<br /><br />Rule 9: Tomorrow is the cause of today's nothing. The promises of tomorrow reduce the chances of today. <br /><br />Rule 10: We do not exist. In comparison to spending your entire life wondering why you exist in the first place.<br /><br />Rule 11: Myths are nothing more than easy truths for idiots. The need to offer easy answers to the general populace only reflects it's inability to think for itself.<br /><br />Rule 12: Assume only that you know nothing. Within silences you will learn what you need to know. The difference between knowing and assuming is vast. To assume is to fail miserably at acting intelligent enough to know when to keep your mouth shut.<br /><br />Rule 13: The past is a minefield. So follow only those footsteps that do not end at the edge of large holes. To ignore the past it is to prolong our mistakes of it.<br /><br />Rule 14: The world is not your oyster. Prying it open ruins your chances of putting it back.<br /><br />Rule 15: No one remembers who you weren't. Just who you were. The realization of your true self far outweighs the consequences of unpopularity.<br /><br />Rule 16: Supreme beings are kind of like pets. They make you feel better when no one else will listen.Strangely enough, neither can respond. The need for something more than yourself ultimately diminishes the need for yourself. <br /><br />Rule 17: Freedom is just a word. If freedom is fraught with regulations then why not just call it Regulated Freedom and stop trying toconvince yourself otherwise? Huh?<br /><br />Rule 18: The pressures of being have no remedy. Just placebos. If guilt and fear were currencies then we would have all started our own religions to capitalize on them by now.<br /><br />Rule 19: The truth is versed in versions, not nobility. If it were we would never have bothered inventing a device that can evaporate an entire city in under a minute.<br /><br />Rule 20: The future is x-rated.  Oh ya, baby. Oh ya.<br /><br />- Matt Good<br /><br />Other stuff:<br /><br />From matt's January 1998 Manifesto.<br /><br />Radiohead - OK Computer. Someone had to replace Pink Floyd. This record is the pop anti-christ. The mere fact<br /> that it did so well proves that there are still people out there that haven't been wholly consumed by the Spice Girls -<br /> Backstreet Boys reign of terror. Hopefully, they'll win that Grammy for record of the year.<br /><br />From Matt's August 1998 Manifesto.<br /><br />August 1998 <br /><br /> Disorientation <br /><br /> I'm so unoriginal. I've been hiding out hoping you wouldn't notice. I've been standing in front of your house with<br /> dynamite strapped to my body holding a large clock, waiting. Slumming so fantastic. Open your window. You can hear<br /> it if you listen hard. The ticking of your heartbeat, the rhythm of the traffic pouring down the streets. The mice<br /> scratching under the floor boards are safe to follow when the ship starts to sink. They'll be running in the opposite<br /> direction of the mad scientists. Towards Nhim, towards Nicademus, into the hazy summer sky-glow as the clock runs<br /> out. The score is tied so there's gonna be overtime. Sudden death. The pink pills are for your sanity. So lets go kids.<br /> Lets go… <br /><br /> The Better, Happier Me.<br /> The Better, Happier You. <br /> A Better, Happier World To Live In. <br /><br /> How is everyone out there in happy land? You been taking your vitamins? You been drinking lots of milk and saying<br /> your prayers before bed time? You been good little boys and girls? Hmm? You know Santa doesn't just check up on<br /> you at Christmas time. He's watching all year round. So you'd better be on your best behavior. You'd better be looking<br /> both ways before you cross the street and brushing your teeth twice every day. Santa doesn't like little boys and girls<br /> with yellow teeth. He sends them to an unhappy land where fire falls from the sky and rivers of blood cut through a<br /> harsh, barren, rocky wilderness devoid of plant life and animals (except for man eating wolves and giant three headed<br /> vultures that can rip little boys and girls apart with their claws and teeth like feeble match sticks). So you'd better keep<br /> those teeth clean. You'd better be cooperative and obedient. You'd better be doing your homework, your leg work, your<br /> chores. I can no longer guarantee what will happen if you don't. They have a way of finding out if you're not happy.<br /> They have hidden cameras and informants dressed up like ordinary people. They smile all the time, as if setting some<br /> example for you to follow. Like there's an equation that you're supposed to memorize and use to attain that which all<br /> people strive to attain. Inner peace, humility, civility, the programmed ability to bend. Call it what you will. They're<br /> watching and talking notes. They've got computer files, metal files, paper files, and the cabinets to keep them in.<br /> They're the ones that wrote the handbook. You remember the handbook don't you? Everybody gets a shit kicking. You<br /> don't have a choice in the matter. They've brought in seasoned professionals to make sure that you get one.<br /> Everybody gets one. That's the rules. I didn't make it up, I'm just saying. <br /><br /> So be happy. Happiness is paramount. Your happiness is what's important. Everyone else has their own happiness to<br /> worry about. You just follow the program and keep reading the handbook. Everything will be revealed in time. It is so<br /> written. I am merely a middle man of sorts. I'm just someone who's stumbled onto this information and is leaking it<br /> slowly to the outside. Eventually they'll find me and shut me up. So I'll do what I gotta do. But for now you just keep<br /> grasping for that gold ring, that blue ribbon, that dreamy picture-perfect- magazine you. It's in there somewhere. With<br /> your DNA, what you ate for dinner, and all those terrible secrets. You're in there somewhere, waiting to be reborn. The<br /> better happier you. If you play your cards right the possibilities are endless. There's an equation for everything. For you,<br /> for me, for everything. Everything's been pre-arranged. Mostly for the better. Mostly for the worst.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Uhh, I like different things.  Not different things as in weird, but as in variety.  Yeah thats a good word, variety.  It's spelled weird though.  Hrmm.  I used to play soccer until I sprained my ankle at a tournament because a girl tripped me.  I used to surf too, but ankle.  I just started making weird electronic music.  Maybe I'll get a website, maybe I'll post some mp3s of it.  They suck though.  I also have a picture of myself, sorry ladies, no nudies.  Uhhh, I play drums in a band.  I used to be guitarist and lead vocals in a Lemonhead tribute band.  I started a Ramones tribute band called "The Last Ramone."  I read sometimes.  My favorite book is, "The Stranger" by Albert Camus.  Classical literature however important it may be it is unbearably dull.  I can play piano by ear.  I'm trying to learn the end of "You and Whose Army."  I had a dog two weeks ago, but it got ran over.  I saw Radiohead in Houston, 18 June 2001.  Thom waved at me, I think.  If you've read this far, I will tell you that you must be severely bored.  If you wish to read on, I will say my favorite Radiohead album is probably OK Computer, sorry Thom.  I think Amnesiac and Kid A both have its validity, I am still listening to them so I could change my mind.  I got drunk once, and I ended up nude puking in a community urinal in a college dorm.  That was funny.  I am reading Franz Kafka right now, a collection of his stories.  I also like alot of punk rock, and ska, and just about everything except for bling bling gangstah rap, mainstream country, and new age techno, because it has no soul!  If you've read this far, thanks for taking an interest in me.<br />

Just for the record, I never liked the title Have a Nice Day! -- I always wanted Blood and Sweatsocks. So if my life story makes it onto the big screen, or even goes straight to video or the History Channel, then by golly, Blood and Sweatsocks it's going to be. Unless of course they pay me a lot of money. Then they can call it The Adventures of a Fat Guy in Tights Pretending to Fight for all I care.<br />

In Seattle, police caught a man with a case full of papers and cards claiming various different identities. They had thusfar ascertained that he was none of these. The problem was that they couldn’t find out who he really was. The man said, "They arrested me, it's their problem to find out who I am, I know who I am." The police sergeant said "This man has baffled our system" <br /><br />

nice german music
this is just some info about German alternative bands that usually might not draw your attention... you can ckeck their websites as soon as i've found the urls (or you search on your own) and maybe you can also listen to them on Napster (as long as still possible) or some other file-sharing system. <br />So lets get on with it:<br /><br />: : BLACKMAIL singing in English, check the song Same Sane <br />KANTE - die Summe der einzelnen Teile<br />SURROGAT - ROCKER<br />: : NOTWIST also English lyrics, you MUST check Chemicals <br />: : SLUT sing in english as well, Welcome 2 is quite nice<br />: : BLUMFELD, german lyrics, listen to Verstarker<br />: : TOCOTRONIC the BEST band singing in German that i know. Begin with Jackpot (:P)<br />: : EINS ZWO are probably the coolest Hiphop-squad in Germany right now<br />PLUS<br />german hip hop rules<br />check out:<br />absolute beginner "hammerhart"<br />nina "doppel x chromasom"<br />nico suave "vergesslich"<br />kinderzimmer productions "doobie"<br /><br />mouse on mars<br />&<br />kreidler<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Hello. <br />What's to say?<br />That site contains a lot of my pictures. They are considerably prettier than my photo, and I spend a lot of time on them. I like writing, which I discovered about a week ago. <br /><br />Aside from the obvious, I like Nick Cave, Tom Waits, The Beatles, Janis Joplin, The Band, Belle and Sebastian, Gomez, Cousteau, and allsorts. I also like love hearts, old fashioned telephones, and cooking, my new guitar, and books. <br /><br />i havent posted on the RHMB for a long time. i've been busy, i hope people still know who i am.<br />

Peretti" <br>To: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Greetings,<br>My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate any of<br>the<br>criteria outlined in your message. The Personal iD on my custom<br>ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word "sweatshop."<br>Sweatshop is not:<br>1) another's party's trademark,<br>2) the name of an athlete,<br>3) blank, or<br>4) profanity.<br>I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the<br>children that made my shoes. Could you please ship them to me <br>immediately.<br>Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti<br>From: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>To: "'Jonah H. Peretti'" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD Customer,<br>Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen <br>contains,<br>as<br>stated in the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang".<br>If<br>you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization<br>please<br>visit us again at nike.com<br>Thank you, NIKE iD<br>From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <br>To: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD,<br>Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM<br>XC USA running shoes. Although I commend you for your prompt customer<br>service, I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was<br>inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's Dictionary, I<br>discovered<br>that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not slang.<br>The<br>word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long <br>hours<br>at low wages and under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates from<br>1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first<br>email.<br>Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about freedom<br>to choose and freedom to express who you are." I share Nike's love of<br>freedom and personal expression. The site also says that "If you want<br>it<br>done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build<br>my own shoes, and my personal iD was offered as a small token of<br>appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my<br>vision. I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and<br>reconsider<br>your decision to reject my order.<br>Thank you, Jonah Peretti<br>From: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>To: "'Jonah H. Peretti'" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD Customer,<br>Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE<br>iD web site that "Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD<br>up to 24 hours after it has been submitted". In addition, it further<br>explains: "While we honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every<br>one.<br>Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of certain<br>professional sports teams, athletes or celebrities that Nike does not<br>have<br>the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider<br>inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products.<br>Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that<br>may<br>otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you know if<br>we<br>decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to<br>submit another." With these rules in mind, we cannot accept your<br>order as submitted. If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with<br>a new personalization please visit us again at www.nike.com<br>Thank you, NIKE iD<br>From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <br>To: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD,<br>Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request. I have<br>decided to order the shoes with a different iD, but I would like to <br>make<br>one<br>small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of<br>the ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes?<br>Thanks,<br>Jonah Peretti<br>As one forwarder writes:<br>... this will now go round the world much farther and faster than any<br>of the adverts they paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage<br>packet<br>of all their sweatshop workers in the world to do...<br>I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,<br>but this time I say:<br>JUST DO IT<br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>-------------------------------------<br>The information contained in this message is confidential and is intended<br>for the addressee(s) only.  If you have received this message in error or<br>there are any problems please notify the originator immediately.  The<br>unauthorized use, disclosure, copying or alteration of this message is<br>strictly forbidden.

the website above is for the Radiohead Message Board Music Site which exhibits original music created and performed by musicians and bands influenced by Radiohead.  There is also a section up now for bands to post their Radiohead covers.<br /><br />If you would like to see what i spend most of my time and energy doing, check out my band's website:  www.protocolband.com - you can hear our original music, read about us, see pictures of us, post your thoughts on us, and all of that exciting, edge-of-your-seat internet entertainment.  If you do check it out, please tell me what you think, good and bad aspects.  Send your opinions, complaints, suggestions to ProtocolHM@aol.com...<br /><br />My other board names:  Stereopathetic Soul Manure, protocol, Corporal Clegg, today has been a fucked up day, obscured by clouds, green is the colour... don't go on too much though.<br /><br />

Rene Descartes
Only through Reason is it possible to achieve knowledge.  When I was young, I accepted my environment and took it at face value.  However, since I have grown in maturity and responsibility as an adult, I realize that this world I see around me is fleeting and, quite possibly, an illusion.  Such a work of fantastic deception could only be accomplished by a supernatural power with malevolent intent, and since God is by nature good, then God exists.  And this world is not an illusion.  Thank You.<br /><br />

I wrote such brilliant songs as "Don't Pass Me By" and co-wrote (read: SAVED) such songs as "What Goes On," which those wankers (more on them later) had almost bollocksed right up.  Also I recorded, kid of wrote and sang (and played drums!) on such critically acclaimed albums as "Beaucoups of Blues" and "Ringo IV."  My solo hits (which were far better, being untainted my the influence of those 3 wankers -- again more on them later) include gems like "Your 16, You're Beautiful & You're Mine" and "All I've Got is a Photograph."  George H. wrote both of those so he's slightly less of a wanker.  Those dirty bastards Paul and John, however, were no-talent acidheads who knew nothing of the drums.  Listen to "Back in the USSR," for instance, recorded during the brief period in 1968 in which I wisely chose to leave those bumblers behind & go solo!  Pure shit, that track is!<br /><br />In short, I am a golden God.  I love you and I hope you love me too.  Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue -- 'cos you know darling, I love only you.<br /><br />Kisses, hugs and intense musical talent shared only partly in your viewing of this radiant profile,<br /><br />Richard Starkey.<br /><br />

I used to have lon ass dreadlocks, so if you see someone on our site with dreads-thats me about two years ago. I went to school for three yrs <br />as a jazz commercial performance major but dropped out once the band got going.Oh yeah I play drums. Lessee what else....... <br />I rock at crossword puzzles and I paly in a side proect called big in japan, that plays all improvised live drum and bass. <br />I am obviously a huge radiohead fan, but I also like-coltrane, elvn jones, nirvana, pixies nick drake, amon tobin, luke vibert, aphex twin <br />thelonius monk, larry young, wayne shorter, godspeed you black emporer, old medeski martin and wood, all the native tongues, clutch <br />bad brains, circle jerks, etc. Blah blah blah-I dunno if you want to know anything else don't hesitate to ask. for tour dates <br />and such just go to laketrout.com I love you all...... really.<br /><br />likes Jesus, RH, REM, Lord of the Rings, the Matrix, Last of the Mohicans, traveling ANYWHERE, new people, new things, new music, playing guitar, daydreaming, laughing, making people laugh, italian & mediterranean food, Jerusalem, seeing Radiohead live in Arles and Frejus, being a chameleon, road trips, okay can't come up with anything else creative to try to tell you who i am. if u want to know, chat with me on rhmb (i can be shy on there) or e-mail me and i'd love to talk ;) <br /><br />Hey don't have much to say at the moment , only im a friend of Punk Floyd (she told me to say that) <br /><br />I'm blackstar..also known as eva..also known as intramoenia..and im still drunk..still punk..still junkie..still unhappy..still crazy..<br />still wild..still scared..still sad..still falling..still crawling..<br />How i'd ever end up here?<br /><br /><br />"when you are certian, it is certian that you have put limitations on you mind." -Alister Crowly<br /><br />Thom, thank you for taking the time to write to me. xxxx <br />Also people, keep your eyes open for the Radiohead Mini of mine buzzing about with the blinking bears on it...Beep if you see me. <br /><br />shauneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! <br />and um... here, sheep! *feeds you chocolate ice cream* <br />LEAVE ME A MESSAGE <br />that isn't my web page. it is shaun's. he says it is empty but i think it is coming along very well. there is beautiful artwork and soon there will be more. you will also find me there. <br /><br />"in the winter i'm a buddhist; in the summer i'm a nudist" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />a friend of mine sent me a quote once and it's really <br />changed the way i look at living. so i thought i should <br />pass it on to others and make them feel happy...as i am, <br />as he has made me. maybe i'm just being sentimental or <br />maybe i'm just listening to nick drake <br />too much. well, here it is: <br /><br />"Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. <br /><br />It is our Light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be. <br /><br />You are a child of God; your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. <br /><br />We were born to make manifest the glory of God/the Divine within us. It is not in just some of us. It is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. <br /><br />As we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others." <br /><br />Nelson Mandela <br /><br /><br /><br />oh and leave me a message....i love messages!!! <br />and i will love you forever if you leave me one. <br />thanks. by the way...hi to alex...cause he's the only one that i know who looks at these profiles. *mwah* <br /><br />welcome one and all.my name is jay and i welcome you to my profile. thank you for looking at me. my low self esteem has now been boosted because i now know wthat someone cares. thank you so very much. we are accepting donations for the get jays ass to europe fun,if you would like to contribute please send a check to jay kraft, 29 frdricks drive lake katrine ny 12449. thank you. im about 5'9 brown hair and devilish good looks. i play guitar and write alot of things. i sing too, not very well but i try. ok i think im done rambling. god bless and carry on. <br /><br /><br /><br />names a-b. more to come. you people are fucking wretched. please, please dont ever forget it.<br /><br />

bands: Radiohead, Travis, Remy Zero, Foo Fighters, Tori Amos, <br /><br />who i am: i am the quiet girl who sits in the back of the classroom, too self conscious to say a word, but smiles politely when a smile is needed. a dreamer.<br /><br />what i've learned from the rhmb: <br />1. goldfrapp, arab strap, sigur ros, jj72.<br />2. people here can be nice, people here can be mean, but if you ever need the band name and only know two words of one song, they are the ones who know. :)<br />3. lovely people exist even though we don't always see them.<br /><br />Random musings: <br />I wish I were in a band. Like a permanent one. Its so cool to play music (not my own even, but cover songs) in front of people. I think it's the only time where I feel proud enough/ courageous enough to stand up and talk aloud. Silence is what plagues me otherwise...<br /><br />I've only recently started venturing onto the Radiohead MB. I started visiting around the time Fran came over from the travis board to chat on the rhmb. Everyone was being pretty snippy with him though...which i resented. No one was showing Fran any hospitality, which they should have. Especially since both bands share Nigel :o)<br /><br />But I've learned that there are some cool rhmb posters here and I'm glad that I get to talk/listen to them.<br /><br />I dunno what else to say here. Hello *waves* <br /><br />--Edited 1.6.02-- eek, some of what i wrote last year on this thing is pretty stupid. But, I've decided to keep it for some odd reason. Why? Dunno, maybe so that i see how or if i've changed as the days fly by. hmm. perhaps...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

Okay. Radiohead, yeah, they're nice. But anyone looked at the art work on Amnesiac recently? It's scary. It's damn scary. Yeah, so can I start a campain? You know, to get Stanley Donwood on Prozac. That way when my mom walks in and sees the CD artwork thing in the ground she won't be like: 'What the hell is it?!" And I'm all like: "DEAR GOD, MOM! I DON'T KNOW TOO!" It's just liek there. So, I was thinking. Yeah, maybe. That it would be a good idea..for...erm people to talk more. MEAN RADIOHEAD FANS SUCK. They suck more than mean people. Take for instance I'm going to the Houston gig and while I was waiting in line I was bouncing about hyper as hella s usual tryign to talk to these people. And damn, they were unfriendly. That's right. Everyone go hug themselves. I'm sick of you RH fans trying to act all posh by wlaking around thinking it's not cool to not smile. That's gothic for crying out loud. Gothic, man. And that's more trendy than GAP these days. So everyone, you know, be nice. Smile and wave. And dance a lot too. DANCE LIKE KEVIN BACON IN FOOT LOOSE! Because he's got moves. I mean, I think Radiohead would be selling a lot more records if they started getting some little dance numbers down. Like those, erm, Jackson 5 type moves. Hey, that might be cool. And if the music sucks then you watch Thom go off and start singing like Micheal Jackson. Oh yeah, I'll be at the Houston gig by the way. So remember, be nice. And if you aren't a nice person..they Fuck Y'all and Be Happy. :)<br />

I'm a weirdo.. I'll let my reputation on DA' board speak for itself though... I'm only 15 but its never too early to have good taste in music.. something you should tell to my peers! hhmmmppfff.. lousy teeny bopping, limp dick loving posers! GRRR! Its hard to find a decent conversation with someone my own age but I get by with my friends... my friends are a rare bunch though... Anyway only I don't ever bother searching for people my own age own age.. some of the best conversations I've ever had are with this one 35 yr old women with a kid MY age... <br /><br />If you want to know anything else about me... i.e; a more in depth look at my musical taste then go to the about me section on my page.. it also has pics of me ;)<br /><br />Enjoy! <br />Ed<br /><br />P.S: I love radiohead and radiohead's fans.. a highly cultured bunch of oysters... *Bows..*<br />

Useless Bastard
Useless Bastard is actually just a Bastard who misplaced his original password several years ago.  Luckily with the rebirth of the RHOMB he is like Lazarus risen from the grave.  If this is any indication of just what a big loser he is just wait until you meet him on the message board.  He tends to lurk, suddenly pounce, and then just a quickly run away.  He is undergoing Chemical Therapies to help him continue to live and late at night is know to bitch about how it makes him sick.  He is fanatically devoted to Radiohead as they are his favorite band.  He is also a musician and a first rate musical snob.  So actually he sucks. . .<br /><br />And now far a Story mein friends. . .<br /><br />The terror that we call modern life is slowly getting on my nerves. A horrible case of the fear is crawling up my back. I’m discounting everything and beginning to fill up with self-doubts. I’ve tried to hold back the bile but my ducts are overflowing with it. I have to let the bile out somehow. It’s a black sticky viscous substance. It’s pours out of my sweat glands and begins slowly filling up the room. At first I don’t realize that I’m in any immediate peril. I’m still too caught up in feeling sorry for myself. <br /><br />It isn’t until the bile is somewhere up around my waist that I pull myself out of my funk. Suddenly I panic. So I force myself through the muck over to the door. I try to get it open. Damn it’s locked from the other side. Either that or it could be that the door only opens inward. There is too much bile pressure against the door. Oh my god I’ve let it fill up too much!<br /><br />I watch in horror as the bile makes its way up my chest. It climbs up over my neck and then onto my chin. Slowly it fills my mouth and then begins to clog my nostrils. I start scrabbling about frantically searching for some purchase in this dark pool of self-loathing. I can barely breathe. I kick myself to the surface. Each time I surface I gasp for breath.<br /><br />Unfortunately the bile is still getting deeper and It’s becoming harder and harder to surface. I make one final frantic push for the surface. I take a deep breath but I lose much of it as I stink back down. I know that the damn stuff is up around the ceiling by now. I’ve got to find a way out of here. It’s just so damn black and dark.<br /><br />Then I start to feel the icy fingers of apathy clutch my legs. It creeps up my spine like the venom of some spider heading toward my brain. Complacency begins to fill my head with thoughts of giving up. My thrashing becomes less violent. I can’t see anything anymore anyway. The bile is far above my head now. For a moment I find it funny that I’m not dead yet and everything is already black.<br /><br />I suddenly remember the smell of her hair. The sparkle of her beautiful green eyes. The fact that I can’t remember her name doesn’t seem to bother me. I go limp. The sound of my heart beating, in my ears, is deafening. I realize that this is it. It’s all over. Then I’m filled with one final panic attack. Help me I’m drowning. There must be a way out of here. God please help me. I thrash about once more. But there is nothing I can do. My panic causes me to expel the last bit of air from my burning lungs. I want to cry but I can’t. I want to scream but I can’t. I open my mouth and the bile surges down into my throat. I no longer have the strength to gag. I go limp for the final time. <br /><br />I can feel the edges of my consciousness begin to fade. The sound of white noise fills my ears. Like a chorus line of a thousand angry crickets. I can’t think clearly. Nothing makes sense. I see her again, this time she’s draped in a haze of fading colors. I still can’t remember her name. I want to remember her name.<br /><br />Black.<br /><br />

"Calling psychiatric drugs medicine while at the same time labeling illicit drugs and alcohol as poisons is a triumph of sorts.  It is a triumph of MARKETING OVER SCIENCE, OF JUSTICE OVER COMPASSION.  It is also a triumph of denial and evasion.  By this hypocritical labeling process, we can deny the devasting societal impact of a CORPORATE HEGEMONY that worships MARKETS RATHER THAN LIFE..." -- BRUCE LEVINE: Z MAGAZINE<br />

I live in Houston. I grew up in Connecticut, and I love that area of the U.S. It' s much more agreeable to me than Houston.The only good thing about Houston is my high school, Memorial HS, all my friends there, and the band. I am in the band and I play clarinet. I also play guitar, and I write quite a few songs. I do not have any MP3's availble to downlod yet, sorry. <br /><br />I now play guitar in two bands. there is no information on this yet, sorry.<br /><br />I am a blue Maoi in a carpark.<br /><br />VR<br />

Welcome to the Monkey House
Even, I love the MGB.  I still love radiohead!  oh yeah, i hate YOU though. *joking*<br />i also LOVE MANY MANY MANY artists.  And I love so many styles of music.  People think i'm crazy.<br />They don't need to think, they know...because i am crazy and i do belong in a nuthouse. End.<br /><br />If you're really bored, sitting, and looking at your computer screen...and you've got nothing else to do..<br />please, be my guest, and read on!  The rest of this is just babble!  Don't mind me, i'm just a nonsensical<br />talker.  <br /><br />Probably most of you don't know who the Matthew Good Band (MGB) are.  They're a kickass group from<br />Canada (Vancouver, BC).  If you are interested in discovering them, and you have napster, i would<br />recommend Apparitions, Load Me Up, or Strange Days!  You can contact me, if you want me to recommend<br />more tunes!  or you can just visit the official website www.matthewgoodband.com<br />If you live in certain parts of the world (not exactly sure where!), you may even find their latest album,<br />Beautiful Midnight, which debuted at #1 in Canada.  I told this obsessed Radiohead fan I met in a <br />Napster chatroom the other day, to get Apparitions.  He had been a crazy "Radio head" for years!  He<br />loved the song so much, he got a hold of the album, through online shopping.  isn't that cool?<br />And NO!  I'm not MGB's PR agent either.  Just a very dedicated fan.  I'm not advertising.  I'm just giving<br />you the chance to check these guys out.  I mean, what have you got to lose?  just give a shot.  If <br />downloading shit, is a pain in the ass for you, you can bet MY ass on this one, that you'll love what you<br />hear!!!  <br /><br /><br />

I'm kind of a geek/nerd : I study multimedia (aiming at managing web projects, or someting to that effect) in Paris, and spend most of my lunch time on the web (and that's because I don't smoke. And that it rains outside at the moment).<br />Still, not really a geek : I actually had sexual encounters with human people of the opposite sex (so forget about left hand, dog or anything, thanks).<br /><br />Yes, I do have a dog. That's not the point.<br /><br />And, no, I'm *not* single anymore. So sue me.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Summary :<br />talk : French, English<br />about : Anything and also : Radiohead, Guitar, Music in general, Books, Computers, Movies, Internet Wandering, stuffs like that...<br />Oh, by the way, my real name is Xavier...<br />

you soulless godfucker
Will you stop complaining about the state of music today?  You spend so much time wishing bands would make the same exact music you listened to in the 80's you've missed the point altogether.  Do you really believe Radiohead should be your personal protest placard, that Thom Yorke should have to commit musical suicide just for you?  The reason nobody makes the same records they did in the 80's and 90's is because THEY ALREADY FUCKING MADE THOSE RECORDS!!!  It's time to move on.  Let go, for fuck's sake.  And stop trolling the message board calling Radiohead sellouts.  I don't give a flying FUCK what GYBE! have to say.  I wish I'd never heard of those fucks, but you can thank Radiohead for that one.  GYBE! and anyone else who bitches and moans about record companies and the true indie spirit can suck my ass in near obscurity till the end of time!<br /><br /><br /><br />

Zippy
He was the gingery-yellow coloured one-armed, err, thing, from whom the viewers would learn all the valuable lessons that they would require in life. <br />Either that or they would learn how to behave like troublemakers and disrupt proceedings when everyone else was behaving in a thoroughly sensible manner...<br />Zippy always had to be in the right. On the rare occasion that he outsmarted someone, his smugness would be shown by breathing on his knuckles and rubbing them on his chest.<br />I think that this would result in Zippy having a high opinion of himself, thus increasing the potential of rude remarks on Zippy's behalf.<br />In my opinion, general greed is the instigator of Zippy's misbehaviour. It is a combination of all the above reasons plus a general ignorance and inconsideration towards others. That is what makes Zippy great.<br /><br /><br />

I'm a political Science major, very much into history...and how we seem to forget all the things we've already done (and made such horrible messes of)...did you know one of the definitions of "INSANITY" is to keep repeating the same mistakes (actions) hoping for a different outcome then being dissapointed when it doesn't happen....anyways I digress... I read and read and read anything I can get my hands on.  I write and write everything down that either interest me causes some distress or thoughts that I can't quite seem to complete in my head.<br /><br />Sorry I'm sure this is terribly boring to you...however this is the very substance that is me.<br />
