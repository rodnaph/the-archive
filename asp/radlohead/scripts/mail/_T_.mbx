Thestoryofo:#:stans little mouse:#:please excuse my endless rambling...:#:<br><br>hey gorgeous!<br><br><br>thinking about you again...<br><br>gazing into those beautiful blue eyes of yours...<br><br>i'm so glad that you love the things i say to you... i adore the words you use too...<br>i still find it difficult to believe that nobody has ever said anything like this to you before... i can't be that unique in my romantic or naughty thoughts, surely?<br>you deserve to hear such beautiful words and read them every single day of your life, my angel... you are so precious and have such a warm, open heart... i find it hard to believe that nobody has discovered and appreciated this before...<br><br>you are special... *warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br>these days, i find i am thinking about you constantly...<br><br>i also wish i was closer to you... one day soon this will happen, i'm sure of it... we just need a little more time... and there's always plenty of that...<br><br>you sensed that i had something on my mind... i do... it's all a little complex for me, although it may sound quite straightforward to someone else...<br><br>i'm sorry... because it's probably going to be more than just a little long-winded, this message...<br><br>okay...<br><br>i fell in love with someone (well, i mean we both fell in love)... as a result of the internet... someone who i can never be with... and i need to get used to just being a really close friend to them... i'm still a little lost in the whole thing...<br><br>so... i fell in love, not long ago, with a beautiful woman across the other side of the world... america, to be exact... we were friends and we met through the internet, much in the same as we did... and we spent a lot of time exchanging thoughts and comments by email... and then later through internet chat, as we do... she fell in love with me first, whilst i felt like a reluctant bystander - watching everything unfold, yet unable to grasp what was happening... she is married and has a young child... i held back my emotions, because it didn't seem right or fair to become so deeply involved... but eventually i fell... i fell from a great height and was madly in love... this i know will seem bizarre, considering that neither of us had ever actually 'met'... but, somehow, being able to exchange so much information and respond so instantly, and to not be afraid of saying anything to each other... to be able to lay our hearts bare... it made the bond so tight, and so close that it truely hurt like hell to be apart... both physically and mentally... we communicated every day, online and through messages... we became so close that we completely lost sight of the reality of the situation... <br><br>we knew each other for months before we actually sent each other pictures, so we could look into each other's eyes and dream... then, one night she decided that she had to hear me speak... i was concerned whether i would be able to do it or not... but she persuaded me to do so, and i called her... i heard her voice on the answerphone and left her a message... i was so excited that i could hardly speak... the whole situation seemed unreal... then she called me and did the same... we were both in fits of giggles and so high about everything at that point... suddenly i think it hit her... she was talking to a stranger on the other side of the world... who she had fallen madly in love with, but only knew me by my words, my picture and my voice... and because we had spent so long 'chatting' without knowing much about what we looked or sounded like, i think it shocked her to realise that i wasn't the same person she'd obviously built-up in her head... this was something i hadn't really done, myself... and i was delighted to see her face and hear from her at long last... plus i think at that point, that was the moment when i really did fall completely in love with her... that night we were 'together' for what seemed like an eternity... she struggled to make sense of everything and was terribly upset... this made me extremely upset too, for some reason... <br><br>i don't think i'd cried for a long time before that point, but that night i really was in tears... one moment i was ecstatic, the next thoroughly torn to shreds inside... she did a lot of soul-searching and soon after decided that we couldn't carry on behaving like this... that the whole situation was impossible... which, of course, is true... what was happening with me was destroying her relationship with her family - that she loves so dearly - every time her husband came home from a week's work she said he noticed her changing... so she took time out and decided that she had to find a way to reconnect with her home life, without also ruining our incredible relationship... see, none of this had happened intentionally, or was instigated by either of us... i often felt that we weren't actually making conscious decisions, but rather that we'd both fallen into each other's hearts blindly, and we were too happy with all the emotion and attention that we couldn't stop falling deeper and deeper into each other...<br><br>so this was all months ago now... we still chat regularly and send each other messages... but, of course, it's difficult now... we do both still love each other, although she decided that she could only  find a way back into her own life was by closing a door to me... the door which led directly to her heart... so nowadays i rarely know how or what she feels for me... the interaction for a long time after was all one way - in terms of romantic gestures... now, i've all but given-up trying to deceive my mind about this situation... i no longer send my special thoughts... or my heartfelt emotions... because i know - even though it hurts her - that she cannot reciprocate such feelings anymore...<br><br>we want to remain the very closest of friends... we share such a lot - things we both love to read, to hear and experience - and we've shared more than our hearts with each other... i'm sure we even managed to touch each other's souls... the feelings i get when we chat are still the same... the heart aches and i choke on my emotions, whenever we talk about our 'relationship'... the rest of the time we are just as we want to be... like best friends, who've known each other for years... we've barely known each other for half that time... but it truely feels like we have... the amount of words we've exchanged and feelings we've expressed is probably as much as many good friends or lovers do in an entire year or more... that's how intense the whole thing was...<br><br>and now... we are both a little lost... i know i certainly am... learning to make the adjustments to cope with the whole situation hasn't been easy atall... and it still isn't... we both still feel the same, yet it can do us no good atall... it's a dream of an incredible love that can never be realised... we came so close, and yet have never even met each other... and i believe that human beings haven't developed enough to be able cope with the situations that this new technology affords us... certainly not this, anyhow... so we both still struggle on... trying desperately to come to terms with everything...<br><br>then one day i 'met' you... i was so happy to find someone who truely understood my desires... i never realised we'd become this close, not for a second... but each day i feel myself being drawn closer to you... i can feel it in my heart now, when we part... i feel a great sense of loss...<br><br>now, i'm sure after reading about by previous experience you have already drawn some conclusions about me, and why i might be so interested in you also... please don't... i appreciate you for who you are... i'm not simply shifting my sense of loss and need for love onto you... i couldn't do such a thing... the fact is that i am still, to all intents and purposes, in love with someone else... although it seems bizarre to suggest so... and yet being with you gives me so much hope, so much happiness and so much pleasure... i'm quite sure that i feel myself being drawn closer and closer to your heart... and i don't want to stop either... but this is where i know i'll need time... i really need to deal with all these contradictions rolling about inside my head and my heart right now... it would be so unfair of me to claim that 'i love you' and that i wanted to be with you right now... because i still don't really know what i think or feel anymore... i'm so mixed-up right now, emotionally...<br><br>my love/friend understands... she even encourages me, whenever there's the faintest possibilty of me finding someone i can really be happy with... i sometimes think she feels it's her obligation to find me someone else to love... although she still feels she is holding me back in some way... preventing me from finding someone i can be with... she still blames herself terribly for all that has happened, even though she was never really at fault... i obviously filled a void in her life at that moment, and gave her something that she hadn't - or hadn't for a long time - experienced... she still makes me happy, and i try to make her happy too... with kind words and reassurance... <br><br>i do hope that you understand some of this, kim... and that you don't feel atall jealous or unnerved by this... as far as myself and her are both concerned our 'passionate relationship' is now long over, and only the memories remain... we are both desperately trying to keep our heads and maintain a really wonderful friendship after all that has happened... i do hope you undestand... you are the only person i ever speak to in such a way now, and to whom i express such emotion and desire...<br><br>i just wanted to be straight with you and explain for once and only, i hope, why i may seem a little... erm... as if i am 'holding back' or something... it's merely my past experience of such things, coming to the fore, when i'm feeling doubtful or insecure... i am a very emotional and sensitive person... i do take matters of love very seriously indeed... i wouldn't want you to think i wasn't ever being anything but completely honest with my feelings for you at any time...<br><br>you were such an angel to explain your situation to me early on... and your desire to move on and find some greater happiness in life, that maybe you feel you have been left without... i am so glad that i make you happy right now... i hope that one day i can make you even happier... i do hope you still feel the same way as you have told me you do... i so adore us 'being together' in whatever way possible... right now, unfortunately that's via a very long set of wires... but not forever... i also hope you understand why i am so reluctant to visit you, whilst you are still in a relationship, in some way - and whilst i am also trying to deal with the after effects of a previous 'love affair' (if you can call it such a thing)... i do care for you so deeply... and i mean everything i say, and how i say it... if i felt i could say them with total confidence, i would use those three most magical words for you too... and i will... but only when i can be sure that i really mean them... until then, please accept everything else i do say - with the kindness, love, warmth and affection they are intended to convey...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*tender loving kisses*<br><br>byebyefornow... my beautiful angel.<br><br><br>i adore you.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>:#:988343558:#:1

Thestoryofo:#:stans little mouse:#:i'm a very naughty boy...:#:<br><br>hiya gorgeous,<br><br><br>you are so adorable. you make me feel very special. you said that you wanted me to send you something naughty to read. i don't know if this quite fits the bill, but i rather like it anyhow. i hope you like it too. *hugs and kisses*<br><br><br>mistress calls, and demands my presence in her room...<br><br>i walk in and see you standing over in the far corner - dressed immaculately and wearing a seductive, evil look on your face. i'm stunned. i stand at the door, not daring to move.<br><br>"well... come on in then, before i change my mind... and shut the bloody door you idiot... do you want me to get cold?"<br><br>i do as you say, then walk into the centre of the room and stand motionless. you walk over and slowly pace around me, carefully examining. you hold a black riding crop in your hands, which you brandish intentionally as you walk. you are wearing a beautiful black studded choker around your gorgeous neck... a beautiful shiny black corset - encasing your body tightly - showing a generous amount of cleavage, which pulses deliciously with every move you make... you are also wearing a pair of tight black leather gloves, which come up above your elbows... a pair of black leather panties - looking almost like a chastity belt, with the amount of straps fastening them up... and you strut around in a pair of incredibly vicious-looking shiny black leather high stiletto boots, which come up to just below your knees.<br><br>i am mesmerized by your deep gaze. you stand in front of me and look me directly in the eyes.<br><br>"undress... now!"<br><br>i hurriedly remove my clothes... unbutton my shirt and throw it to the floor, kick off my my shoes and pull off my socks... i begin unbutton my jeans, but you tell me to stop. you prod my naked chest with your riding crop.<br><br>"do it slowly, and properly. i want to watch this, you fool!"<br><br>i apologise: "yes mistress, i'm sorry."<br><br>i carefully unbutton my jeans and slowly push then away from my waist, glancing back to seek your approval. you nod and utter a gentle "hmm...", as i continue to remove my jeans carefully. i kick them away as they fall to the floor. you sneer dismissively - prodding at my limp penis with your crop.<br><br>"not much of any use there, eh? ...what the hell do you expect me to do with that? ...pathetic! aren't you?"<br><br>i slowly nod back.<br><br>"SAY IT! ...go on, tell me what a useless fuck you are!!!"<br><br>i attempt to reply...<br><br>"i'm sorry mistress, i'm a useless pathetic little fuck. i don't deserve your attention."<br><br>you cut me off, as i speak...<br><br>"damn right you don't! ...but let me see if i can use you for something. nothing too demanding of course, you poor brain can't deal with anything too complicated, can it???"<br><br>"no mistress"<br><br>i reply, with my head bowed low.<br><br>"get on the floor, now!"<br><br>you demand, pointing to the floor.<br><br>"kneel down there, quickly!!!"<br><br>"yes mistress" i hastily reply.<br><br>i crouch and fall to my knees in front of you, hurting myself in the rush. you laugh at me, covering your face to hold back your hysterical reaction.<br><br>"you can't do anything right, can you? ...you fool."<br><br>i gaze up at you and frown, as you continue to laugh at my stupidity.<br><br>"i don't want you to be hurting yourself before i've had a chance to deal with you, do i?"<br><br>"no mistress"<br><br>"you won't be much good to me as a slave, if you're going to keep injuring yourself when i ask you to do the most basic things... WILL YOU?"<br><br>"no mistress, i'm sorry mistress"<br><br>"when i want you to feel pain i'll make sure you do... not when you decide to ... do you understand?"<br><br>"yes mistress, i understand"<br><br>"GOOD! ...maybe we'll make some progress if you start doing as i say, for a change."<br><br>i gaze up at you, adoringly.<br><br>you just laugh back at me.<br><br>"don't be getting ideas, boy! ...you can save those looks until you've done something to please me. NOT BEFORE!!!"<br><br>"yes mistress, i'm sorry mistress."<br><br>"i'll wipe that stupid smile off your face!"<br><br>you turn and walk into the corner... rummaging through a cupboard... then you turn and walk back over, holding something in your left hand...<br><br>"i don't want to see that silly grin anymore..."<br><br>you grab my head and hold me by my hair, hurting my scalp badly as you tug. you wrap a dark silk gag around me, over my mouth and pulled tightly into a solid knot behind my ears. i breathe hard through the material, but cannot speak properly. the best i can do is utter a muffled groan.<br><br>"there... that should calm you down for a while... does that feel good?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"that's better..."<br><br>you turn and walk back to the cupboard again and bring out a pair of ankle chains and handcuffs.<br><br>"...and whilst i'm in the mood for tying you up, these will prevent any further interruptions"<br><br>you pull my arms behind my back and cuff them, then lock on the ankle braces.<br><br>"if you're so dumb that you fall flat on your face, you'll have to crawl back on to your knees, because i'm not doing it for you... understand?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"good. that's much better. you look far more useful when you are restrained, it helps to focus your tiny brain on the important things, doesn't it?"<br><br>i nod again.<br><br>i watch as you pace around the room, examining me - all tied-up and completely helpless on the floor. i feel my penis begin to grow erect, as i gaze in your direction.<br><br>"have you been touching yourself again today?"<br><br>i nod.<br><br>"you filthy sod! ...did you do it over a magazine?"<br><br>i shake my head and mumble.<br><br>"were you thinking of me?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"you filthy piece of shit! ...how dare you!!! ...did i say you could do that?"<br><br>i pause, look down, and then shake my head.<br><br>"you know what i said i'd do, if you disobeyed me, don't you?"<br><br>i nod, slowly... gazing at you...<br><br>"and you thought i wouldn't do it, did you? ...you thought i'd overlook your filthy habits?"<br><br>i shake my head and try to mutter 'sorry mistress'.<br><br>"too right!!! ...i'm not letting you off this time. you hopeless fuck!!!"<br><br>you kick me with your stilletto boot and i tumble over backward on to my side, awkwardly. you kick me again, this time in my back, and force me to lay on my stomach by pushing me down on the floor...<br><br>"get your face on the floor, you shit!!! ...and don't fucking move!!!"<br><br>i hear you walk off into the corner, and i stretch my head round to catch sight of what you are doing. you stand in the corner and pick out a really nasty-looking tawse. then you unfasten the belts around your leather panties and remove them - exposing your gorgeous naked buttocks, fully. i turn back as you walk over to me, brandishing the tawse in your gloved hands. you straddle my body, standing over my buttocks... slapping my cheeks lightly, in swift strokes with the tawse, so i can feel a subtle stinging sensation.<br><br>"you feel that?"<br><br>i attempt to reply, but can only mumble.<br><br>"your flesh is remarkably free from wounds. i've been slacking with you, obviously. you're in dire need of a little discipline..."<br><br>i feel you draw back a little, and stop stroking my arse with the tawse... then i feel a warm jet of spray hit my back, and i realise that you are pissing on me. i moan with pleasure as i feel the gorgeous warm spray hit my naked flesh, and trickle down my body...<br><br>"you useless fuck! ...it's all you deserve!"<br><br>i continue to moan as your urine trickles out over my skin... i hear you testing the tawse against your gloved hands... and then i feel the first lash over my back... i gasp hard under the gag.<br><br>"disobedient fuck!!! ...you'll get as many of these as can be bothered with"<br><br>you continue to lash at my damp flesh with the tough leather tawse. as it begins to cut and sting me badly, i start to moan, with a mixture of ecstasy and pain.<br><br>"QUIET!!!"<br><br>i try to muffle my yelps of pain as best i can. i bite in hard on the gag to numb my instinctive reactions. you lash at me a few more times, before you stop... panting heavily from the whipping. as you catch you breath, you snarl back at me...<br><br>"did that hurt???"<br><br>i try to reply, in a muffled groan...<br><br>"i hope you understand now, why you deserve such punishments... why you make me resort to such methods... you need to be taught a few basic lessons, and learn to understand them..."<br><br>i groan in approval...<br><br>"come here, i'm not finished with this yet..."<br><br>you grab my head and pull me up on to my knees again, forcing me to face you... as you do i feel the urine slide down my back and sting at my wounds... i bite hard to numb the pain and close my eyes tightly.<br><br>"now you know what it feels like to disobey me!"<br><br>you grab the knot on my gag and pull it free. i gasp, as i take my first breath of air...<br><br>"open wide!"<br><br>you force my mouth open, then pull me close against your wet vagina - smothering my face once more... i can feel the bittersweet taste of your urine on my lips...<br><br>"i'll let you have what's left... i know how much you love it..."<br><br>you giggle as you begin to piss into my open mouth and down my throat, drenching me completely... almost choking me with your urine...<br><br>"swallow! ...go on ...i want to hear you gulp it down!"<br><br>i swallow a mouthful of your fluid in one go...<br><br>"oh, how adorable... you enjoyed that, didn't you?"<br><br>"yes mistress, thank you mistress."<br><br>you gaze down at my fully erect penis, dripping wet...<br><br>"oh, look at that... that's a bit of an improvement, isn't it?"<br><br>i gaze down...<br><br>"yes mistress."<br><br>"i MIGHT be able to use that for something now... yes..."<br><br>you poke at my hard wet penis with the sharp tip of your boot... i wince a little as you rub against the glistening, exposed head...<br><br>"that could come in handy that little thing..."<br><br>i gaze up at you, looking down at me... examining me carefully... i feel so hot... i want to cum all over you right here and now... but i just kneel below you and attempt to stay still, as my penis grows ever more sensitive...<br><br>"ohhhhhh!!! ...look at that!!! ...disgusting!!!"<br><br>"mistress?"<br><br>"look what you've done now!!!"<br><br>you point down, and i see the tip of your shiny boot covered with in a small amount of my fluid, where you were rubbing against me...<br><br>"how dare you!!!"<br><br>"sorry mistress, i didn't mean to..."<br><br>"clean it off NOW!!! you filthy sod!!!"<br><br>"yes mistress"<br><br>you push my head down towards your foot and force me to lick away my filth from your boot tip...<br><br>"and make sure it's all gone!"<br><br>i lick hard into the black leather, tasting my own juices on your shiny boot tip...<br><br>"that'll do! ...i don't want you getting any clever ideas... you can only have that pleasure again, when you've done something to please me... and seeing as how you're not doing a very good job of anything so far, i doubt that will be very soon..."<br><br>i move back and frown...<br><br>"sorry mistress."<br><br>"and i should think so too!!!"<br><br>i gaze at your feet...<br><br>"i'll have you lick them again when i've been out wandering in the dirt... then you can give them a thorough clean for me... you'll enjoy that, no doubt?"<br><br>"thank you mistress"<br><br>i gaze up at you and smile...<br><br>"that's better... less of that frowning... or i'll give you something to frown about!"<br><br>i feel my penis growing harder and harder as i gaze up at you, your vagina fully exposed in front of me, still dripping wet...<br><br>"come here... i have something more useful for that tongue of yours to do..."<br><br>you pull me into your vagina once again...<br><br>"lick!"<br><br>"yes mistress."<br><br>i lick in deep and hard, cleaning away all the excess fluid left inside, and licking away the urine from around your skin... rubbing over your clitoris with my warm tongue as i do...<br><br>"that's rather nice... don't stop... keep going for a while..."<br><br>"thank you mistress!"<br><br>i continue to lick harder and faster... you begin to moan a little with each stroke of my tongue...<br><br>"mmmmmm... yes... very good..."<br><br>i begin to dribble on to the floor, as my penis grows stronger and more sensitive... i'm desperate to fuck you now, but wouldn't dare even suggest such a thing...<br><br>"that's enough for now... i'm clean now..."<br><br>"yes mistress"<br><br>"you like to serve your mistress, don't you?"<br><br>"yes mistress, i do"<br><br>"i think i'm going to untie you... i want to have a little fun now... we'll see if you can manage this... you should be able to... it's not too demanding..."<br><br>"thank you, mistress"<br><br>you remove my cuffs and ankle braces, and pull me to my feet...<br><br>"come over here..."<br><br>you drag me with you over to the bed in the other corner... stand me facing away from it, then push me back... i fall on to the soft sheets and gasp a little...<br><br>"don't move!"<br><br>you crawl over me, like a wild animal examining it's prey after an energetic hunt... you stare straight into my eyes...<br><br>"don't even think of touching me!!! ...or i'll rip you to shreds!"<br><br>"no mistress... i wouldn't dare"<br><br>"you'd better not..."<br><br>you slowly lick up my naked body, over my thighs, and up my torso... teasing my nipples between your teeth, biting hard... i try not to move, just wince a little... gasping for air... my penis is fully erect and dripping with fluid.... rubbing up against your body, wherever you move over me... spreading my wetness over your flesh around your thighs... i want to fuck you, hard...<br><br>"mmm... you taste better today, since i left my scent on you..."<br><br>i can barely breathe... i want you so badly, but dare not move... you look adorable, yet vicious... i know if i do move that you'll hurt me badly...<br><br>"mmmmmmmmm..."<br><br>you slowly lick down my body again... over my stomach and down towards my pelvis...<br><br>"i'm hungry... i want something to eat... what's for dinner?"<br><br>i gasp.... i dare not speak...<br><br>"this looks tasty..."<br><br>you lick at my fully erect wet cock, sucking on the tip delicately...<br><br>"mmmmmmmmm... that does taste rather good... it's all mine!"<br><br>you take me in your mouth suddenly... i gasp for air... i can't move... i'm pinned to the bed... you grab at my torso and run your fingers over my flesh, pressing me down hard with your gloved hands, as you begin to suck on me harder and harder...<br><br>"mmmmmmmmmmmm..."<br><br>you take one of your hands and begin to touch yourself as you suck on my hard wet cock... i can't hold back much longer... i'm gasping with pleasure... i'm desperate to cum... you let your tongue slide about over the head in a circular motion... it feels incredible... you grab my cock in your gloved hand and begin to masturbate me into your mouth...<br><br>"come on!!! ...let me taste you!!! ...i want it all, now!!! ...i want a mouthful"<br><br>you continue to masturbate yourself whilst sucking on me again, even harder this time, letting your teeth rub over the tip as you do... driving me insane with pleasure... all i can do is lay still and gasp like crazy... the sensation is too much to bear any longer... you take it out of your mouth once again, and lick the tip... letting your saliva dribble all over the end... lubricating it fully... then you grab my cock again and thrust it into your cleavage, rubbing it in and out between your corset-encased breasts... i want to come right now... but you are holding be so tightly that i can't... even though i'm desperate...<br><br>"come on!!!

Thestoryofo:#:stans little mouse:#:i'm far too sensitive for my own good...:#:<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i'm writing you this message, in the vain hope that you might check your inbox... or even be able to check it... because i'm sure that right now there is no other safe way of contacting you...<br><br>are you okay, my angel? is everything alright there?<br><br>i'm sorry for irritating you at oxford, it's the very last thing i wanted to do... but i just found it really difficult to pretend i was a vitual stranger, when i feel so close to you... and you looked so beautiful... i felt rather numb, not being able to be closer to you, or tell you what i was feeling... and you definately do not look awful in the morning, or even when we got drenched with rain... you still looked gorgeous... your yummy blue eyes are always sparkling and bright... they make me feel something indescribable, deep inside... you make me feel alive...<br><br>i hope you aren't really angry with me... i tried to just fit in, but failed unfortunately... i've become really nervous and insecure since leaving, and i'm scared that you won't want to speak to me - even if you can... i feel like i really let you down, and i wish i hadn't... i actually wish that i hadn't gone there now... i felt that i was in the way... just another 'problem'  that you had to cope with...<br><br>i didn't arrive there in the best of moods... i went in a pub before going into the park and had a few drinks... but when i went to the toilet - and freshened up - i had a massive nose bleed, that took me almost an hour to stop... i was rather fed up after that, and didn't feel atall well... karen stayed with me for a while in the park... but because she was in the enclosure at the front of the stage, she had to leave to go back and keep her place... so i spent a couple of hours or more there, completely alone...<br><br>when you told me what had happened that morning at home, i felt my heart sink... i knew it was the last thing you needed right then... yet another confrontation/ultimatum... and when you said that you might have to stay at home - rather than go and stay elsewhere until the sale had gone through - i realised that things were going to get really awkward for you again... all the space you'd had in the previous week - and your calm and happy state of mind, that i witnessed in london - would be tested yet again... and i knew that it would make the possibilty of hearing from you, or even coming to see you again, incredibly difficult... so i felt really down... and i wanted to comfort you or say something to help you feel better... but i realised that i couldn't say a thing... i didn't know what i could or couldn't say in front of dan... so i ended up going really quiet, and just agreeing with what was already being said... i felt a bit lost...<br><br>i should have been able to cope with this better, but a combination of things made it seem really hopeless... i was seeing everything in a bad light... i felt incredibly insecure and paranoid... i thought you probably wanted me to just piss off and leave you both... but you seemed to want me to follow you around still... i don't know if this was because you did want me there, or were just concerned about me... i probably took everything the wrong way... the more you asked me if i was okay, or what was wrong... the more quiet and awkward i felt... it was abit like those really awkward moments in london, but without a way to resolve what was rolling about inside my head... i stopped looking at you eventually, because i knew i'd just breakdown if you asked me what was wrong again... during radiohead, later on, i was ready to walk off when you said i was really annoying... i was making you angry, and i could hardly speak anymore... i was convinced that i'd fucked everything up, and that you'd never want to hear from me again...<br><br>i was getting really upset by that point... i couldn't believe it when you offered me the chance to stay in your room... i was sure that you just wanted me to leave you both alone... although, i guess you were concerned about what happened to me... i felt it was quite appropriate to hear "i'm not here, this isn't happening", as the rain began to soak us to the skin... and why they chose to play 'creep' last, i'm not sure... but that's exactly how i felt right at that moment... like i just didn't belong there atall... i'm incredibly sensitive, just like you - as you've said before - and so i guess anything awkward was going to be difficult for me to deal with... but i did an even worse job of it than even i thought i would...<br><br>you seemed very self-conscious when we were in the room together... i tried not to stare at you... but you know how i think you are always beautiful, gorgeous and completely adorable, however you look... i'm glad that we still managed to exchange a few warm smiles and glances, that helped me feel a lot better about the situation... i didn't sleep much, although i did get some... everything was still rolling about my head, and i didn't know what to do or say to make things better... when you were getting ready in the morning, you seemed really irritated that i was still there... when i was leaving - and you were getting ready for breakfast - i wanted to say something, to tell you that you looked fine... or ask you to call me, or something... i don't know what was running through my mind at that point... but you really got annoyed with me, and just told me to stop hanging about and go... so i left... i walked back out into the rain... feeling really torn-up inside... as if i'd just lost everything that's precious and special to me...<br><br>kim, i love you... and i'm not sure what you feel about me... i could just be overeacting really badly to what happened... anyway, you probably have much more important things to worry about right now... but please will you try to just call for a few seconds or send a message or something... i want to know if you hate me or not... every moment we have spent 'together' in the past few months, has made me feel more happy and loved than i've been for a very long time... you make me feel so special... and meeting you in london was just pure bliss... i hope that you still feel these strong emotions towards me, and that i haven't just messed everything up... i don't know what i've done, but right now i feel like i'm to blame for all this going wrong... i'm sure i am... and i know that i can't just pick up the phone and call you... so i'm stuck here, wondering if you'll ever speak to me - or see me - ever again...<br><br>i miss you so much, my angel... i hope i hear from you soon...<br><br>*big warm hugs and kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>:#:994673471:#:1
