How she got in I'll never know, but I imagine bribery and/or blackmail played a key role. I suppose we need an old member to appeal to the baby boomer demographic. *shrugs* As for the rumour that I'm jealous of Lovepatch's "shaking" ... if I thought that dancing should consist of spastic-like seizures, why then yes!

You said to email you sometime.....I'm sure this isn't what you had in mind but I'm at school and I'm BORED (we have net fliters so I can't post on the rhmb OR access my normal email account..) and since I managed to get on this thing, why not? yknow..<br>Ok, lalala, I just emailed Kenny on here, sad I know, but whats the chances he'll ever even CHECK his inbox on here? the only reason he found out about this site is cuz I told him, hmm, and afterall *I* never check my inbox here, when I just did I had 1 message from someone who was applogizing for something they said, and that was early April (though I haven't looked in this thing for months..), anyway the point is I'm going to have to tell you to check this account, balhfkgkdhgk I'm rammbling on aren't I? <br><br>Hmm, so I'm at school in the library, I found out that seniors get out of classes on MAy 22, so I'm pumped, WOOHOO!! ON TO A SHITTY COLLEGE!! CAN'T WAIT!!! I'm peeing myself with excitement right now, errrr.....so how are you? Do you guys have grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th..) like Americans do? Fuck, if I plan on studying overseas it might be a good idea to look into this, wouldn't it? I hate to admit this but I am probally too angry/depressed to even function in a college atmosphere, I find myself hating people (not like racists or sexist, but individuals) for what seems to be no reason at all, like on the board there are several people I wouldn't mind if the dropped off the earth entirely (hazey, nari, and several others), sigh, I'm horrible and I know my childhood wasn't as bad as it could of been, in fact it was probally very normal but poor super oversensitive me has fucked herself once again. See this is how it goes, I'll either get there and hate it right away, no time to think..or..I'll get there and act like I LOVE it, like its the best fucking thing to ever happen to me but I'll know its just one big fucking lie, ARGH, I know exactly how I do it, I really do, but I just can't get out of that trap, believe me I have tried I always get in this "I'm going to MAKE things change for the better" persona...yet it never works, even right now I'm thinking to myseld 'this guy doesn't give a shit, why am I writing this...' and yknow what? you don't give a shit, you don't like me, you only talk to me to be nice and I am fucking well awhere of it, and I also know why I'm writing this, it gives me a reason to bitch, I'm at school, I'm bored, you ASKED me to email you, so whynot? <br><br>heh, I hope the school net nanny doesn't filter email messages, I know some schools do, hahaha, watch me get called down to the office for a mental evalution, Mrs Finley....are you reading this? damn..I'm paranoid :P<br><br>I need to take up a hobby or something, like in first grade when we had to write down what our hobbies are for those teacher-student gettingtoknowyou papers, I wrote down "eatting + sleeping" cuz I didn't know what hobby meant *LOL* how sad...<br><br>ummm, whatelse can I say? I already alienated myself from the board, heh, I'm the princess of alienation baybee!!!!! ;)<br><br>its 80 degrees (Farehenight you Austrailian freak..!) hoooooooooot! too bad I'm stuck at school, on a nice day like this I should be at home hiding from the sun and all those creepy "outside" people, lol. DAmn I'm thirsty, why did I skip lunch, oh yes, once again, PEOPLE are in the cafeteria, its another one of my paranoias, can't eat infront of people, though I do just fine in some senarios the cafeteria at school is a nightmare...I wonder if once I get to Kent if it will be the same, I'll be down to a size 2 before Xmas....which would be great if not for the fact I'd have to buy new clothes, I already lost half my wardrobe when I lost all that weight over the summer, I'm even one pants size smaller than all the new clothes that "fit" me are, I have to pig out to keep my stuff, sad...andonce again you don't care...<br><br>I'll shutup now, buhbuy.<br><br>(now you know why I'm friendless...hahahahaha)<br>

I doubt you'll ever read this, but I just wanted you to know that you mean more to me than I could ever say.  I wish so much that you could be here, that instead of thinking of you every morning that I wake up, and every evening when I go to sleep, that you could be here in my arms..  I hope that someday that will be true.  I want to hold you, and love you, and kiss you when you're feeling down..  I want to be able to rock you back and forth, kiss you on the forehead, and tell you everything's going to be alright.  Since I can't do that yet, I'll just tell you, everything's going to be alright.  As long as we both stay committed to the path that we both desire, than nothing will be able to stop us! <br><br>I Love you more than words could ever express.. <br><br>David

hi,<br>  Be very careful about when you attend a party I read and heard about roofies and how people put them into drinks ...terrible stuff. Guess what...wait dont guess, I acually got some peoples attention by writing to them first Ive got to stop thinking that everyone else needs to react to me first jeez!I started going to the boards alittle after new years eve and I didnt get them at all it looks very strange if youve never seen it before.But have a nice day. Be safe those women at parties always try to take advantage of men! :P *HUGS* <br>              Bye,natalie<br>  Ps: Happy easter although its alittle early.<br>

yep yep
Hi,<br>  What do you mean if you are lucky girls take advantage of you?...silly boy :P I dont do drugs because Im already messed up to begin with all paranoid,I have a nervous twitch its awful!!!Oh yes Im addicted to the boards when my father said I wasnt allowed to go on them anymore (im not allowed to take to people I dont know ya'see) I thought I was going through withdrawl! I would get all crancky and then id finally get there and it was like a sigh of relief...ok maybe Im the only one like that. But I think its fantastic to meet new people espesially people that live so far away and that youd never be able to talk to in your daily life (such as yourself)but I think its completely safe talking to people on the computer they cant stalk you and its not like youll run into them on the street one day...Id hope everyone wasnt psyco here,well except for me but everyone knows that :P talk to you later hun :)<br>                      *hugs*<br>                    take Care,Natalie

i am having one helluva time with your appleonline addy, or whatever it is... for some reason your server and mine are at odds.  i can only send you things about 1/2 the time.  so i changed your default to the gnp@globalnet.co.uk   let me know if i need to change it.  maybe it will work better.  i just sent you a weird email at the globalnet addy.  i am not sure you will like it.  i am rambling and being strange.  strange day i think.  lots of stuff banging around in my head.  i have a feeling the email will make you feel insecure.  i dunno.  maybe not.  we havent been able to spend a lot of time chatting these days.<br><br>so anyway... write me a note back and tell me what you are thinking.  like i said in the other email... it looks like tomorrow is out for a chat.  busybusybusy.  yuck.  maybe i will try and pop on for a bit, who knows.  i doubt it though.  :/   <br><br>i hope all is well with you.  i am starting to ramble again!!!!!!!!!!  eeeeeeeekkkkkkkk!!!!!!<br><br>see ya sweetie.

agonised heartfelt response
I'm sitting here in an English lesson writing this - its 10-30 - I'll type it out when I get home.<br><br>I was almost late for work this morning as I overslept a little and decided to see if you had written to me before I got dressed - told you that you;re always on my mind.  I was so thrilled to see that you had and it took me ages to read so I really had to race to get ready after that.<br><br>Regarding your message to me, once more you have left me not knowing what to say.  Where do I start?  It roused a very mixed bag of feelings, I can say that much, and I am very grateful for the time you must have spent trying to string words together to be honest with me and trying to make things clear.  As I was reading it I felt extremely emotional and had feelings ranging from total joy to utter distress.<br><br>It is very easy to say things like I hope you don't feel jealous/hurt/used etc and my common sense tried to take over and tell me to get a grip - this is only a screen with a total stranger at the end of it - but both are easier said than done.  I shall try hard not to feel any of those negative things but..... can't help it mister, I do a bit if I'm being honest.<br><br>When I'm spending time with you it almost feels like you are mine - just who I've always wanted and then sometimes the reality kicks in and I feel stupid for having such feelings - especially so quickly - and I think to myself that I should have kept my mouth shut perhaps.  I feel like I'm scaring you off.  I don't mean to get all heavy - I just say what I am feeling at the time - I certainly don't want to put you under any kind of pressure as I adore you far too much to do that.<br><br>I am very sad that you feel so hurt and wish that I could make you feel happier, thing is, it isnt me that you want is it?  I can only wish that it was.<br><br>But on a more positive note I was overjoyed to read how much you enjoy being with me and I hope that that will continue for a long long time - I think about you so much and I do really want to carry on talking to you and sharing things as we have done - what you have told me has not made me want to disappear - its really had the opposite effect.  Dont feel guilty about not being able to say things you dont mean - it is far more important to me that you do mean what you say and I am delighted to know that you are being truthful with me.<br><br>I shall talk to you later on and I am really looking forward to being able to spend hours with you tomorrow night.<br><br>I miss you badly and think I love you regardless of how you feel about me.  Hugs, kisses and bliss - Kim xxx<br>

I bought something lovely
which I shall tell you about later when we meet for our marathon session.<br><br>I had a rummage through my wardrobe (one of them) today to see if I had anything nice in leather and I put on this gorgeous long skirt, that I have probably already told you about, which I havent worn for years (I got too chunky for it but it fits me like a dream now).  I had never really noticed the 'creak' factor before but this one is soooooo noisy.  I bought something to go with it in Notting Hill this morning, it isnt particularly mistressy (more rockerish I suppose) but it does look ever so nice - very tarty indeed.<br><br>I now need suitable footwear as it doesnt go with shiny fetish shoes - see how much you're costing me mouse!!!!! and I wont wear any of it until I wear it when I come to meet you (hopes your gonna like it).<br><br>Only a couple of hours now until I talk to you again - it feels like an eternity!<br><br>Oh and by the way (and this is not being pushy either) I need your address (or an address) cause I made you a copy of the Festival Hall bootleg - dont panic - I wont charge up to Southport and lurk outside your door (well, maybe I will *giggles*)<br><br>I'm missing you like mad here baby - got this weird kinda ache, which hurts, all because I'm missing you so much.  Oh I just wish that ................... nevermind.<br><br>*places gentle little kisses all over your unbelievably beautiful sweet face* - *sighs deeply*<br><br>See you later - heaps of love - K<br>

just thinking about you yet again
Hello beautiful one,<br><br>Got home from work earlier than I expected today so I thought I'd write to you as I cant think of any better way to spend the time at the moment.<br><br>Have very little to say really but just wanted you to know that you are on my mind and that I can't wait to talk to you again.  I woke up early especially to see if you had written to me and was so delighted to see that you had - made me feel all lightheaded and special.<br><br>I do hope that I can come and find you tonight but I have lots of things that I have to do and its not always that easy when people are around and I have to try hard to keep the peace, but I'm sure I'll manage to sneak in here for a bit - it wont be for want of trying anyhow.<br><br>Just to let you know that I wish I could be with you - I miss you such a lot.  I really do think you are gorgeous, my precious little mouse.  Have to go now, but I'll still be thinking about you whatever I may be doing.<br><br>Wish I could see you smiling - gonna love you always - K<br><br><br><br>

I'm sure thats what you'll turn out to be.<br><br>I can't stop reading the messages that you send me - they make me feel so lightheaded and wanted and so many other nice things.<br><br>You are a very bewitching mouse.<br><br>I'm looking outside of the window here - a pretty view of trees and fields but it is getting darker and its rather grey and gloomy again and I keep wondering if I'm looking in the right direction to where you are.  I want to be able to see you so much.<br><br>You say that you are so far away from me but you are not really - I feel that you are very close when you are talking to me - yet it feels like the other side of the earth when you're not.  At least the physical distance between us isn't enough to pose a serious problem if we still feel the same way later on and do get to see each other.  Perhaps I should only speak for myself as I dont really know what you're feeling - I cant see inside your head no matter how hard I try.<br><br>Today has been one of those days when I have thought about you and little else.  I wrote you a note this morning and sent it to you this evening so it should reach you by Thursday, they couldn't guarantee it getting to you by tomorrow as I got there just as it was closing - if you had seen the length of the queue you would instantly realise how much you mean to me!<br><br>I have about an hour until I talk to you again - seems like forever - I miss you all the time.  I just cant wait, even though I dont always have an awful lot to say, you can rest assured that I am feeling things very deeply here.<br><br>I shall go now and speak to you very very soon.<br><br>Missing you so much it hurts,<br>love to you - Kim<br><br><br><br><br><br>

something to look forward to every day
Dear little mouse,<br><br>I do so love reading your messages to me - as I have already said they give me something to look forward to every single day and you never ever forget, which I think is so cute.  You stay up hideously late though, such a bad habit.  You can't stay like that because you would never be able to sleep with me and that would make me cry.<br><br>Several people commented today that I seem so happy lately, which is true.  I feel very decisive about what I'm going to do in the near future and I also have you now and that has made me so happy you wouldn't believe.<br><br>You are so beautiful and so so precious.  What more could I ask for than for someone who thinks about me all the time and who troubles themselves to let me know that.  I feel very lucky.<br><br>I am being left alone here an awful lot now, for which I am grateful, and that gives me more of a chance to communicate with you in whatever form that takes.  I don't ever feel lonely when you're around.  You make me feel very special and wanted.<br><br>Wondering if the postman bought you my letter, but I doubt it - it will probably be there tomorrow - so glad that you are all excited about it.  Would love to watch you when it arives, all excited like a big kid, I promise I'll write you a better one in the very near future.<br><br>bye now<br>love and kisses<br>Kim.<br><br><br><br><br>

A jaunt in the park eh!
Dearest gorgeous mouse,<br><br>I've got grass stains on my best frock now!!<br><br>Oh you are so so delicious - what can I say.  I was all smiles and dribbles when I was reading your sweet message.<br><br>And this morning you didnt let me down, not that I should ever have doubted you, and I drove off to school feeling very special, desired and happy.  I just hope that you feel the same even though I am not as good as you at saying what I'm imagining - believe me I am thinking the most glorious thoughts about you all day long.<br><br>I wrote you another letter today but I binned it because it didnt sound quite right - I dont even know what it was that that I was trying to say but I do know that it was difficult trying to put down on paper what I feel about you - that someone wonderful in the distance, who I dont really know, that makes me feel like I do - how do you word that, wish I knew.<br><br>I am dreading not being able to talk to you tonight - its only the thought of being able to speak to you tomorrow that is keeping me from totally losing it.  Even now, with you in my head as I sit here typing, I'm getting very wet and getting that ache all over again - blissful!<br><br>Right now what I'd really like to do is watch you undress and slowly nibble at each new exposure, nothing more than that, and tell you how much I adore you and how delightful you taste - ohhhh yummy!  I'd have to wank after that - wanna watch?!<br><br>I must go now honey before I get far too hot and dripping, I have a visitor tonight and I do have some standards!<br><br>I will write soon - and I cant wait to talk to you again tomorrow.<br><br>Bye bye beloved mouse,<br>your special Miss O adores you.<br>xxx<br>

wants to wake up and find a mouse in bed
hello beautiful one,<br><br>yet another message to greet me - I absolutely love it - makes me know that you must be thinking about me sometimes, but I shouldnt think that you do so as much as I think about you (but perhaps you do)<br><br>I had such a wonderful day yesterday, I know I've told you that already, but I feel so happy today as a result of it.  It was gorgeous talking to you, I cant think of any better way to spend the time.  Hearing you makes me go totally weak, a gorgeous feeling, and I never want to go.  You are such a special creature.  I'd love to keep you here with me always and never let you out of my sight.<br><br>I did get a bit worried when you went extremely quiet on me as I was about to go - I panic and think that I must have upset you or made you feel awkward in some way - I dont mean to - I just have to say what's in my head sometimes and I want you  to know how you mean so much to me, thats all.<br><br>Anyway, sorry this is a bit brief but I have things to do if I'm gonna be sitting here at 6 talking to my beautiful baby - which I shall be.  I can hardly wait!<br><br>Talk to you soon angel face.<br><br>xxx<br>bye, K.<br><br><br>

 very few words to say but just thought I'd let you know how very special I think you are.  You make me so happy and I think you're wonderful.  Everything seems so much brighter now that I have found you - and you make me soooooooo fucking wet!<br><br>I could spend forever licking you all over, think thats what I'll be dreaming of shortly.  This evening has been one of the strangest experiences I have had for such a long time, and it was totally gorgeous.  Just being able to hear you breathe while I got off was bliss and I have never ever done anything like that before - see what you are turning me into!<br><br>I couldn't go to bed without saying something to you - its so difficult sometimes to know what to say when I'm on the phone but it gives me such a buzz that I'll never want to give it up.  As you said, it might get a bit easier as time goes on but I really feel desolate when I put the phone down, even after long silent pauses.  Its just heaven to hear your voice and it makes me feel like you are present in some way.<br><br>I shall go to bed now.  Remember that I am thinking of you always.  Bye for now sweet baby.<br><br>Love K.<br>

darling darling mouse
thank you for my message - it wasnt here when I left for work and I was all lost - poor me!<br><br>I found it more difficult to leave you last night than at any other time - you are so gorgeous and I just cant bear to be away from you right now.  I still feel so sorry that I made you all sad - I wouldnt want to hurt you for the world - I really cant quite manage to express what you mean to me and I'm already so excited about seeing you - I know I'm gonna die!<br><br>You say such sweet things to me - knowing that you mean them too makes me feel a bit unworthy as I often think you will be so disappointed with me and that you deserve someone far better, even though more than anything I hope that you wont be.<br><br>I am sooooo looking forward to talking to you again tonight.  I will have to try to be good though as I slept for about 3 hours last night and my lack of sleep is starting to show, and we cant have that can we!  I dont want you being shown up by some dark eyed wreck when we stroll around the park in Oxford.  I'd never forgive myself!<br><br>I want you to know that I am always thinking about you - really gorgeous thoughts - and I cant wait to put some (or all) of them into practice.  I miss you so much honey and I love you very much.<br><br>Talk to you later,<br>love and cuddles, Kim.<br>

such a beautiful creature
thank you for writing to me again - this time I got the message before I went off to work and I felt all happy and nice.  I slept a bit better last night but it still isnt really enough - I have a lot of catching up to do in that respect and I shall be having quite an early one tonight to try to make up for the loss over the last few weeks (not that I am complaining - I'd far rather be spending my time with you angelface).<br><br>I will still come and find you later (couldnt last a day without my mouse) but I will have to keep it rather brief *cries*.<br><br>So I've spent yet another dreamy day thinking about you for most of the time and wishing you could be close to me - I'm doing an awful lot of wishing these days - all of which have something to do with you baby.<br><br>I really cant wait for the day when you can give me a big cuddle for real and a long wet kiss - the thought of it all makes me go extremely peculiar.  I cant wait to attack you with my tongue and discover how you taste - that thought keeps me awake for hours and hours! *gets very wet*<br><br>Back to reality - must go now cause I have dull domestic things to do before I can come on here and talk to you again.<br><br>You are my beloved little creature and I miss you so much.<br><br>Big warm cuddles and lots of lingering kisses, all my love from Kim.<br>xxx<br><br>

dont know what to say
hello beautiful,<br><br>I just cant think of anything to say (that I havent said before).  I miss you already so much and I'm feeling all achey again thinking about you.<br><br>Right now I'm still having such confusing feelings about my current situation and I'm worrying a lot about the practicalities of it all.  My mind keeps wandering from the things that I know I have to do and want to do, to things that would be easier solutions to it all.  I'm having to be very strong here and its not easy at all.  I am not good at hurting people, even those that have hurt me deeply.<br><br>It all had to happen sometime I suppose and I keep telling myself that even if I allowed it to carry on (which is the simplest option) that I would only find myself in this same position time and time again and that it would have to end anyway.  No doubt the longer I had left it the worse it would have become.<br><br>Oh I feel so dreadful today.  All that is keeping me going right now is the thought that someone somewhere (meaning you) cares about me, and that does really help, believe me.<br><br>I think you are so truly wonderful and I would dearly love to be with you.  You are always on my mind and that helps me through this more than you will ever realise.  I'm sure that life can be better than this so that is what I must hang on to when I feel like giving in.<br><br>And you are so naughty....... making me do things that I would never dream of doing *blushes*<br><br>I shall miss you enormously today - what shall I do with myself?  (better not answer that one).  I shall look out for you later but dont worry if I cant as I have got up late and I have school work to do.  If not I shall find you here tomorrow evening - I know that I wont possibly last any longer than that without being with you somehow.<br><br>Remember baby that I think the world of you and that you are so very very precious to me.<br><br>I must go now - busy busy busy.<br><br>Talk to you soon gorgeous one - bye bye - I love you - K.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

You make me feel so so special whenever you are around me and I hope that you do too.<br><br>But I am far from perfect - I am a real human being after all and I hope that you realise that - faults rarely occur in dreams do they?<br><br>I worry about being too old for you, not pretty enough, ravaged a bit by time and childbirth - I can make myself feel rather ugly if I sit down and think about it long and hard, and of course I dont want you to imagine me that way, I'm not so bad I suppose, but I would really hate for you to believe that I am something that I'm not.<br><br>You on the other hand are not too far from perfect are you.  You're gorgeous, cute, intelligent, dead sexy and divinely sweet natured - don't feel like I measure up somehow.<br><br>I do so hope that you like me and that the things you say are one day realised.  I am longing for the time that I can see you.  You are on my mind constantly.  I just don't know what I would do without you now - be very very sad, thats for sure.<br><br>I love you baby, really I do.<br><br>Talk to you sometime later.<br>bye bye angelface - K.<br>xxx<br><br>

my special baby
its such a lovely feeling, waking up and finding that you have written to me again, sending my off on my way with such beautiful thoughts.  You are making such a hard time much, much easier for me.<br><br>Although I dont know what will become of us, we really cant tell, you have made me realise that there is much more to life , and you have also made me realise that there are people in this world who do have deep feelings and emotions as I do and I no longer feel so lonely and sad.<br><br>I am becomming more and more convinced as the days go by that I was meant to be with you.  I think that we fit together so well, which is a rare and precious thing.  I feel very close to you in so many ways.  All we can do now is wait and see how things evolve and hopefully nothing will change regarding our feelings once we meet each other.  I am longing to see your beautiful face and stroke your hair and see how cute you are when you smile.<br><br>I know my messages are very brief but I never know what to say to you - I tend to drift off into a dream when I am thinking of you, which is what I am doing right now.<br><br>I shall call you at 9 this evening and I am so looking forward to hearing your voice again.<br><br>I love you baby, so much that it hurts.<br><br>Bye bye angel - K.<br>

Mama's Baby
hello beautiful,<br><br>Just read you last message and I feel all faint - it was totally gorgeous, as ever, but somehow even more so.<br><br>I've never found anything so difficult as saying goodbye to you - it really hurts to leave, no matter how exhausted I am I would gladly go without sleep to be with you for as long as possible.  I'm am completely addicted to you and the withdrawal symptoms are not too easy to deal with.<br><br>There is nothing I want more than to be loved by you, its far more than I deserve, and I consider myself so lucky that you do.  I can almost feel you with me, even though you are not here, and that is a blissful feeling, especially now that I know we shall actually be together sometime soon.  I think you do know by now how I cant wait for that to happen.  I also know how awkward and silly I'm going to feel - go all shy, talk crap, blush like an idiot and get all loud, which is what I do when I'm trying to hide my insecurities.<br><br>I just know that the second I see you I shall fall in love with you all over again, knowing I shall feel that way forever.<br><br>Talk to you soon baby.<br><br>Missing you badly.<br><br>All my love to you - Kim.<br>xxx<br>  <br><br>

I love you too baby
Speechless yet again.<br><br>Hello beautiful,<br><br>Just a quick reply, just to say thank you for writing to me - I'm sitting here feeling very woozy after reading what you said to me.  I love you so much that I ache also.<br><br>Today was not such a good day.  I felt very alone and isolated and on the brink of tears for much of it.  But I thought of you when I was feeling very down and that, of course, made me feel much much happier.  It seems to make everything worthwhile, knowing that I will be free at the end of all this trauma, to be with you, and to feel loved and understood and to be able to be myself again for the first time in years.<br><br>You are helping me get through this more than you will ever know.<br><br>You are so sweet to me when I lumber you with all my upsets and problems - you must be such a patient person.  I wish that we could be together soon - patience is not one of my strong points as you now know.<br><br>I just wanted you to know that I'm thinking about you right now and have been for a lot of the day and that I miss you terribly when you are not around and that I long to hear your voice and talk to you again.<br><br>You are my sweet baby and I love you.<br><br>Bye for now - see ya gorgeous, K.<br>xxx<br>

This is the first time in weeks that I've come in here and found no message from my baby - I'm very very distressed!<br><br>What have I done to upset you?  *cries*<br><br>*wanders out of room, sobs and sulks*<br><br>bye bye then *sniffles*<br><br>xxx<br>(I love you)<br><br>

Oh I love giving you kisses!
*kiss* *kiss* *Kiss*<br><br>and thank you for yet another adorable message - its so sweet of you to spend so much of your time trying to make me feel loved and wanted, and it works, cause that's exactly how I feel whenever I think of you or whenever you are around me somehow.<br><br>I'm sorry that I was so grim with you last night.  I suppose I'm gonna feel this way from time to time for a little while.  Just bear with me, things will turn out ok, I just know they will.<br><br>I am under a lot of pressure and it will eventually ease.  It is my fault that I let my work slip and not yours.  I can't get my head around it at the moment and of course I would much rather be spending my time talking to you - there is nothing else I would rather be doing, I love you so much baby.<br><br>Today was better but I did see Paul when I got in as I got home very early and he was a bit shitty with me, accusing me of going behind his back because I rang an estate agent to come and value the house, even though he had asked me to.  He is now looking for property in Barnet so it doesn't seem like the buy out option is now there - but never mind - the end will still remain the same - me on my own with my son, no more hassles, no more upsets (I hope), and the freedom to be with you, which is so very important to me.<br><br>I get so emotional too whenever I speak to you.  I am so glad that I found you.  You are more than I ever dreamed possible.<br><br>One day I will write down one of my fanasies for you, when I have the time.  I dont mean to be unreliable or anything like that but I am hard pressed to find the extra time for anything right now and that will only get worse over the next month or so, but after that I will have plenty of time to write to you, talk to you and be with you.  I havent even been able to pen you a proper letter because I cant sneak any time in class (I have a work experience girl with me for the next week).  I will do though, as soon as I can.  I'm sure that you know I love you and that I think of you constantly.<br><br>I am looking forward to being able to talk to you later, even if it is for such a brief time - I miss you so much.<br><br>I am so in love with you Gordon.<br><br>Bye for now precious one,<br>love K.<br><br><br><br><br>

my beautiful darling baby
hello beautiful one,<br><br>I wish I could tell you that I had a good day but sadly that is not quite true, but it has been useful.  I was met again this morning by Paul as he returned home before I could leave for work.  That is sorted out now and I won't be seeing him until Saturday morning when the three lots of valuers come round.  He is moving out properly on Sunday night (taking the hi-fi and video!) and that might ease things a little.<br><br>I was a mess at work today.  Ruth (the NQT) gave me her mornings release time cause I was so wobbly and I stayed at school for the class photo cause I didn't want to let the kids down.  After that I was told that I could go home - although this was something I didn't want to do as Paul was here, so I went and did the rounds of the estate agents just to see what I'm up against.  Most of the places that I think I can afford are pretty grim but there was one apartment that looked gorgeous - not very big and a bit pricey - but just what I would want.  Trouble is, and everything has to have a catch doesnt it, its not too close to a station, other than that it would be ideal - I might go take a look at it at the weekend sometime and see for myself how easy it would be to get into London from there and if Josh can get to school ok.  It's in Harold Wood.<br><br>Sorry for my ramblings yet again, I haven't said anything nice to you yet have I?  You do so deserve to have someone say such things to you as you are so lovely and sweet.  I love you so much baby.  I wish I could be with you right now, just to feel you hold me and to be able to reach out and touch your beautiful face.  I too am spending a lot of time imagining how it will be when we see each other for the first time - very scary and rather wonderful I should think.  I don't really believe that I will have to drag you around anywhere - it will probably be the other way around.  I'm just so looking forward to it, wandering along the embankment, holding your hand like a little kid, and gazing up at you all gooey eyed and pathetic - it's gonna be heaven.<br><br>I should go now Gordon as I have a million and one things that I must be doing, and if they don't get done it means less time that I can spend with you when you are here, so bye bye angel.  I love you more than ever.<br><br>Kisses, cuddles and anything wet,<br>Love from K.<br>xxx<br><br><br><br><br>

<br><br>hello sweet angel,<br><br><br>i'm missing you terribly. i couldn't sleep atall last night - thinking about what you said - so i just stayed up and did some work instead. it upsets me to know you are being treated so badly, and knowing that i can do nothing to help... it's so frustrating. i hope you are alright. you deserve only happiness and love in your life. i wish i could hold you tightly and tell you that it's all going to work out fine... whisper in your ear and tell you how much i love you... caress your beautiful red lips with mine, and gaze deeply into your gorgeous blue eyes... you are an absolute angel... and i wish i was with you now.<br><br>i'm glad you liked my message, even if you had to rush to see it. the mailbox thingy should be fixed now... i asked the guy who runs the site, and he fixed it for me... so everything should be working again as usual. please send me a message or an email back, when you get the chance, to let me know what is happening...  i'm desperate to speak to you again... i love you so much... my heart aches for you... i can't stop thinking about you.<br><br>sorry this is so short... i'm finding it difficult to write... i can't find the words.<br><br>awwwwww... i care for you so much it hurts...<br><br>i feel rather dumb about saying this, but i'm really concerned...<br><br>sorry for acting so pathetic...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

a strange day - no mouse to play with
hello beautiful one,<br><br>thank you yet again for writing to me.  It was lovely to hear from you and it was another one of those messages that made me melt completely.  You are so wonderful, I love you very much.<br><br>Today has been rather strange.  Paul wanted to take Joshua out and I wasn't too keen on him doing that as it's something he has rarely done in the past and I felt it was just another way of trying to win me over, but he had already asked Josh and I felt that I couldn't disappoint him (Josh that is) so I said yes as long as I went too.  I didn't want him saying things and using Josh for emotional blackmail behind my back.  We went out for dinner at Josh's favourite place which is a little Singaporean place just up the road from here.  I feel really stuffed now!  Actually it went ok because Josh read the situation very cleverly and took over so I spent most of the time talking to him, which was lovely, and then he would talk to Paul so we didn't really have to make too much of an effort to try and act 'normally' with one another.<br><br>There was another outburst last night, long after I went to bed.  He got in late (slept on the sofa of course) but made such a noise that I woke up and came down to see what was going on.  He was on the phone to one of his mates, slagging me off, because another so-called friend had told him that I had been bad mouthing him and saying that I was gonna stay with him, but only because he was gonna fleece me and leave me potless.  Well, the situation isn't exactly untrue but I hadn't been saying this to anyone - just goes to show what a guilty conscience can do!  I have never once said to anyone that I am staying or going, let alone give them any reasons, the only person that I ever talk to about all this is you.<br><br>Still, sorry about all this.  It will be nice when I can talk to you or write to you without my domestic situation being at the centre of everything.<br><br>It was so incredibly sweet of you to feel concerned about me.  I don't want you to be worried about me one bit.  I shall be perfectly ok.  I too would love to spend the entire day with you, wrapped up all safe and secure in your arms and to make love to you all day long - gorgeous thought, makes me feel all tingly!  I honestly can't think of anything that I would rather do than that - makes me want to cry just thinking about it - I do hope that some day these things will really happen and not just remain as dreams.<br><br>I hope that you have a great time today - I know I would, it sounds like a lovely thing to do and I wish I was coming with you *gets terribly jealous*.<br><br>I shall find you tomorrow.  I am at home all day and Paul is working so it can be any time that suits you best.  I shall also try to find you here later on, even if it can only be for a little while (but if I cant, never mind) but you will probably be out at your sisters - I'm not sure when I can or can't sneak in here at the moment because I am not here on my own until about 8 this evening.<br><br>No doubt I will be able to survive until Monday - then I'll have to try and make the most of you as I'm going to Suffolk on Tuesday evening and I won't be back until Friday night.  That probably means that I won't be able to talk to you until the Saturday (but I will try to make a quick call to you sometime while I am away, but that may not be possible either) - believe me, I will try my best.<br><br>Gonna have to go now baby cause people are lurking and I don't like being intruded on while I am trying to write to my precious angel.<br><br>Talk to you soon - remember that I love you and that I think of you constantly.  You are so beautiful and I miss you like crazy.<br><br>See you soon sweetie - bye - love from K.<br><br>xxx<br><br><br>

missing you terribly
hiya gorgeous baby,<br><br>God I'm so bored - how did I ever use my time before I met you.<br><br>I've spent some time talking to Anais today which was nice as I havent seen her for ages - she said she'll be here in 3 weeks time so I hope that I get to see her.<br><br>Awwwww I'm missing you so much - I hate it when you are not around and I'm beginning to wonder how I will cope with not being able to talk to you for 3 or 4 days next week - its gonna be very difficult to say the least.  Now who is being the pathetic one?  Falling apart after a day - what's wrong with me?!<br><br>You would never quite believe how difficult I'm finding this - I want you so much, I feel achey and fidgetty and dont know quite what to do with myself (although I do have some ideas!).<br><br>Right now I would love to be with you, playing with your hair and kissing you long and hard.  I've spent ages like a silly little girlie, gawping at your picture and longing for you to be around me.  I so want to see you and kiss you and be able to hold you close..... I am pining so badly.<br><br>When I see you I know that I wont be able to control myself at all - I think of you all the time - even today as I got ready to go out, I made myself look extremely glamorous and was thinking to myself I wonder if you would think I looked nice, and it seemed really important to me that you would - really strange.<br><br>I hope you had a nice time on your outing with your friend.  I like to think of you having a nice time and being happy.  I worry about you too you know.  I sometimes think you should be out more having a good time - it seems such a waste that you spend a lot of time at home, sitting in front of a screen, talking to a daft cockney tart, when you could be experiencing bliss elsewhere.  You are so beautiful and so adorable, I'm sure that someone would quickly notice that, as I did.  You seem so desperate to be loved and that makes me sad because you deserve to be loved so much and it seems cruel that you are alone.  Neither of us have had it very easy in that respect have we?  I really do hope that one day I might be able to make you happy - whenever that 'one day' may be.<br><br>God I'm waffling now!<br><br>I know that I have some very serious decisions to make this week and that is why I am going away for a few days - to clear my head and think things through as best I can.  I still do not know which way to turn - I know my options and all of them scare me to death.  I just hope that the people who care about me can help me to find the right way.  I have three alternatives in this situation - good and bad in two of them, and one I think will be impossible to bear.<br><br>1.  A total, absolute split and all that that involves - good because I will be free, bad because I will find it very difficult to provide a good standard of living for my son (and myself) and I may end up very lonely.<br><br>2.  Patch things up and put up with my current situation for a bit longer (as I planned to do originally) which gives me time to get out of debt and use the opportunity to milk this for all its worth as I could probably get anything I wanted out of him right now - not my style - but I could give it a go.<br><br>3.  Full on reconciliation - dont think so - I'm not in love with him and therefore that could never work.<br><br>I'm in love with you, so I believe, and that makes my decision all the more difficult.  If only I knew for sure that you were the one for me, this would be so so simple.<br><br>These are the things that I will have to be thinking about over the next week - I have to make a decision soon - I'm not being fair to anyone, including myself, by being indecisive and saying 'I'll think about it' to everything - I just find it so hard to be hurtful and I find it all so daunting.<br><br>I do think the world of you and truly hope that we can be together some day, but I have to be honest and say that I'm not certain that I can do that right now.  If only we had met, if only I could be sure then I wouldnt care about anything else and my decision would be final.  But right now, and its now that I have to decide, do I go ahead and give everything up so that we can be together or do I wait - wait until I know that thats how its gonna be - you and me.  If I do that, then am I being cruel to you? I couldnt stand that.  I could never willingly hurt you.    What am I to do - this is all too much.<br><br>The sensible part of me (not that theres much of one) tells me I should wait a little longer and see how we go, but you said that you wouldnt want to see me if I was still in a 'relationship' with someone else - even if it was a dead one.  There really is no relationship here - I dont let him near me.  And once I meet you I'll know - I'll know instantly one way or another.  But if it means I cant see you by staying here......... oh shit!  This is a headfuck.<br><br>This seems like I'm wanting to have my cake and eat it doesnt it - but thats not true - I just really need to hang around a while to clear up finances to give me and Josh a better chance on our own.  Yes, that is nasty, but mothers get very protective over their cubs and I've had my fair share of the nasties too.  I know that everything is over where me and my (ex)partner are concerned, and that there is no going back emotionally - it really is over - I have not lied to you, I promise.  I feel that I may have rushed a bit because of meeting you (and I am so so glad that I did).  I love you Gordon, of that I have no doubt.<br><br>Excuse me going on - I just wanted you to know what is going on in my head, and I never want to hide anything from you or play games with you - its not like that at all.  I take the 'relationship' I have with you very seriously indeed, more seriously than I should maybe - I dunno - I adore you so much, you brighten up my life, and I could never ever bear to part from you.<br><br>I suppose what I am doing is asking you to be a bit patient (something which I can never be, so thats a bit cheeky in the first place).  I will be in a position to be with you but it may not be as soon as I'd hoped - its now my turn to ask you to give me a little more time, if you feel that you can.  Clearly, I still want to meet you more than anything in the world, and that need not change, unless you feel uncomfortable with it after all I have said.  I do hope that it wont stop you wanting to meet me - I want that more than I can say.  For all this waffling I still dont know what I'm gonna do.  I have promised everyone involved that I will come back on Friday with a solid and definite answer - yes or no - to this split.  You know how much I want it, but I have explained what I need to consider.<br><br>Please please be patient with me, and please believe that I am not trying to play games with you - I'm sure that you must realise by now that my feelings for you are genuine.  I need you and your love more than ever right now.<br><br>I love and adore you baby,<br>talk to you soon<br>Kim.<br>xxx<br><br><br>(worried about your reaction to this - hesitating - do I send it or not - will you still love me?)<br><br>yeah - I think you will (fingers crossed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

yes, i still love you...
<br><br>hiya gorgeous,<br><br><br>what an incredible surprise... two nice long messages from my sweetheart.<br><br>i feel rather embarassed to admit this, but it might make you smile... i woke up on the floor of the toilet about half an hour ago... hahaha! ...i haven't done that for years! ...i obviously thought i was going to be ill, but never was... then ended up curling into a ball in the corner, underneath the loo... one of those 'where the hell am i?' moments! hehe...<br><br>fortunately, the sleep - however long it was - has cleared my head, somewhat, and so i now feel coherent enough to write back to you.<br><br>yesterday was difficult... i was thinking of you constantly... i so wanted to be with you, more than anything else. i understand your dilemma... and i can understand you wanting to stay there a while, whilst you clear any debts you have and become more financially able to be independent... i do understand. the only thing i can't bare, is the thought of you... having to pretend to be nice to someone who has treated you so badly, just for the the sake of this... although i do realise that it may be neccesary. please don't doubt that i will ever stop loving you, and that i couldn't wait for you... you know i do and that i can... it won't be easy... i will need to be in constant contact with you, until we meet... if i let even one day pass without speaking with you, i feel all strange... i can't bare being away from you for long.<br><br>i had an interesting day out. i went with a couple of friends to the lowry, and we had a lot of fun trying-out the rooms with interactive sound and visual elements... we went for a meal afterwards, and i was pining for you, in my heart... when i got back, i checked to see if you replied... but this mailbox thingy still isn't working properly, because it said i had no new messages... and yet... when i decided to check the inbox, there were two gorgeous long notes from you, my angel... but i didn't realise about this, until after my sleep in the toilet. i went over to my sister's flat to keep her company, whist ivan went out with an old friend... she was very tired already, so i didn't stay too long... long enough though to drink an entire bottle of very strange chardonay... which made me feel so icky, afterwards... it was nice though... the cats kept us amused, and we both had a chat about things... nice to do that... i need to do it more often i think.<br><br>omg!!!<br><br>i am missing you so badly!!!<br><br>*pines*<br><br>i can't wait for you to be with me again.<br><br>i want to hold you in my arms and tell you how much i love you... gaze into your adorable blue eyes and kiss you passionately on your delicious red lips... kiss you all over, until you are sore... i want to make love to you all day long, and all night too... you are such a beautiful, warm-hearted and absolutely gorgeous sexy creature... i wish i could be with you all the time, my angel...<br><br>please find me today, or call... if you can...<br><br>i feel i need a proper sleep now... but you could find me/call me later on, if you want me... anytime after midday... i should be awake again, then...<br><br>remember: i will always wait for you, however long anything takes... and i adore and love you, completely.<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much, kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello, you gorgeous creature...<br><br><br>i thought i'd write you something this morning, just incase you check for a message sometime today.<br><br>it was so difficult to say goodbye last night... i started to feel so emotional as soon as you said you had to leave... i needed quite a few deep breaths after that call, to hold back the tears...<br><br>i'm missing you so terribly... i want you to know that i'm thinking of you constantly... i do hope that your stay with your parents helps you find space to catch up with your work... i still feel guilty for making you get so behind with all your marking... i also hope that you manage to make a final decision about what you intend to do next... although, it sounded as if you had already decided what you were going to do, when we talked yesterday... i completely understand if you make choose to stay until you feel more financially secure... i know it will make the chance for us to be together properly a more distant prospect, but not too distant... we will still be able to meet, as you said... i'm sure you will manage to sneak out occasionally for a beautiful romantic liason with your dirtly little secret... once i am living in london permanently - towards the end of the year - i'm sure we will be able to be together much more often. i can hardly wait to be with you, my angel.<br><br>this week is going to be so difficult, i know it is... having to wait so long to hear from you again will be a bit of a shock to the system... i probably won't really feel your absence for a day or two, because you are always with me... deep in my heart... and i can never get you out of my mind... everytime i close my eyes i see you there, gazing back at me... looking so adorable.<br><br>dream of me, as i will be dreaming of you... your gorgeous voice, your wicked smile, your delightful giggles, your beautiful blue eyes, your warm heart, your delicious shiny red lips, your adorable thoughts, your sleek red hair, your gentle sighs, your incredible kindness, your infectious laughter... and all the beautiful things you say to me that make me feel so happy, so wanted, so desired, so loved, so cared for, so special... you are an absolute angel... i know that i will love you forever... you are such an incredible woman, and you deserve to be happy... i hope that one day, not too far away, we can be happy together... i dream of us together all the time.<br><br>you remind me why life is so wonderful... when i can manage to find someone as special as you are... and for you to want me as much as i want you... it's such a beautiful feeling... i love you so much, my sweetheart.<br><br>i want to hold you in my arms for hours and gaze into your gorgeous sparkling blue eyes... i want to kiss your beautiful shiny red lips... i want to taste you... bite you... devour you... kiss you all over your silken skin until you are so sore... lick you until you scream with ecstasy... make love to you all night long, until we are both completely breathless... lay together and tell you how much i love you... whisper beautiful thoughts in your ear, and listen to the sound of your heart beating next to mine.<br><br>please write... or do whatever you can to let me know how you feel...<br><br>ohhh... i miss you, my adorable angel...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*deep wet passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

you are always on my mind...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i tried to resist writing to you, because i know you can't read any of these messages until you return... i just felt the urge to let you know how i feel.<br><br>i think i'm coping with this, better than i thought i would... but that's mainly due to your sweet little phone call on the day you left... such a wonderful surprise... you sounded so happy, joyful and full of positive energy... i felt so much better after our brief conversation... it made me feel so good to hear you like that.<br><br>you were so adorable... i just wanted to give you a big warm hug and some delicious wet kisses, before you left for the week... that would have been so gorgeous... to see the mischevious sparkle in your beautiful blue eyes, as you left me there... to tell you how i love you and care for you, and to hear your say how much i mean to you... to let you know that i'd be waiting for you, when you return... counting the hours before we would be together once again... awwwwww... you are so sweet.<br><br>you are always on my mind... i can't stop thinking about you... i see your face, whenever i close my eyes... i absolutely adore you... you are always with me, deep in my heart... i love you so much, my sweet angel.<br><br>i will write something more, no doubt, later today... i can't go that long without writing to you, even though i know you won't see these notes for a few more days.<br><br>missing you, my sweetheart... can hardly wait to hear from you again...<br><br>speak to you soon, my angel...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

please don't leave me!!!
<br><br>hey sweet angel...<br><br><br>i miss you so terribly...<br><br>oh gawd... that message you sent, it really got to me... somewhere really deep inside... something i've been hiding away from... and now i feel it all again...<br><br>i've been trying, and failing to write you something for a while too...<br><br>i was going to write to you on monday anyway... but i feel i have to reply to your message right now...<br><br>it seems like ages since we last chatted together, and it was really nice those last couple of times. i was so afraid that you had just decided not to 'speak' to me again, or even write to me... i felt numb, the longer it went on... every single day i think about you too... i keep remembering how it was when we first chatted together, before everything really happened, and we were just really good friends... i know we can never be just that, not now, but i hope we can still write and chat as friends... the very last thing i want is for you to stay away from me... it tears me up inside to think that i'd never hear from you again... i know how easy it would be for you to just stop communicating with me, given our distance from each other... and how you could easily stop replying to my messages... i got the feeling that this had already happened actually... it's only because i've been able to talk to kim every day that i managed to stay sane, i think... and not get too upset about things... (sounding selfish, i know).<br><br>i don't want you to stop chatting and writing to me. i know that i need you in my life, somehow...<br><br>kim makes me incredibly happy, and i do love her, but it's difficult (when is it ever easy for me!)... she won't be able to leave her place until the new year now, because her spiteful ex has been trying to rip her off financially and is making it impossible for her to find somewhere decent to live with her son - without being totally penniless in the process... so, she has to stay whilst she becomes more financially secure... this means, of course, that i can't be with kim until next year... not properly... and it hurts, but there's nothing that can be done about it... i have to console myself with the fact that we will actually be able to meet occasionally... but this is with the knowledge that she will have to return home to a situation she resents greatly.<br><br>kim has been away this week, at her parents... she needed time to think, and catch up with some school work... so she needed a bit of space, away from things.<br><br>i could do with someone to talk to... i get terribly paranoid and insecure at times... you know?<br><br>kim says she loves me and that she feels it and means it deeply, and so do i... but we still haven't met... so we can never be sure until that actually happens... i still think, in idle moments, that i'm destined to be alone... no matter how hard i try... i know that i sound stupid when i say these things... but it's just happened so often, that i have nothing but some vague hope to cling onto these days...<br><br>i so miss our conversations lisa... i wish i still had someone i could share everything with... i can't ever talk about miles or mingus with kim... and i'm not sure she has any real interest in my artwork... i really miss some of that interaction... and i miss your kind words and your ability to have me in fits of giggles, constantly... you've always managed to make me feel so happy... you really are a great friend, lisa... i hope you want to stay my friend too...<br><br>things have changed, i know... but i do still love you... and i do still feel those deep emotions, whenever i think about you... and i do still dream about you... i care so much for you, my angel... please don't go... not now, not ever...<br><br>please stay.<br><br><br>i love you lisa.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

you are so gorgeous...
<br><br>hiya sweetheart,<br><br><br>it was so good to hear from you yesterday - even though it was only for a brief moment - it made me very happy that you came to say hello. you are so sweet... my adorable angel... i'm so glad that we found each other.<br><br>i missed you terribly, my angel, but i didn't get all silly and write you lots of messages... it felt daft for me to write you things that you wouldn't see for days, so i resisted the temptation... although it was very difficult not being able to hear your voice, or read your reassuring words each day. i love you so much kim.<br><br>you are forever in my thoughts, i can't stop thinking about you... you make me feel so special... you've brought so much happiness into my life.<br><br>hehe... you just called me on your new phone... how sweet of you... it's so great to hear your voice again... it feels so good... you sound so positive... so full of energy... really happy... i hope you are. awwwwww... that made me so happy, to know you are thinking of me all the time. i absolutely adore you.<br><br>i wish you weren't so suspicious of me... i hope you are joking with me... but i sometimes feel as if you have the idea that i go hunting down girls whenever you aren't around... i can assure you that this isn't true... the only females i ever talk to aprt from you, my sweetheart, are my mum, my sister, and a few friends... only one beautiful angel has my heart, and all my love... and that's you.  *kiss*<br><br>i'm going to do a little work now, and dream of your gorgeous blue eyes, until you come looking for me again.<br><br>speak to you soon, my sweet angel...<br><br>i can't wait to be with you...<br><br>*big warm hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

how do I reply to all that lot!
I've just spent ages reading all the wonderful message that you left for me.  You are so wonderful, I dont know where I would be without you.  It was so beautiful finding out how much you had missed me and all the lovely things that were going on in your head.  I was so desperate to talk to you while I was awau but I didnt get a single second where I could go off on my own with any privacy.  and yes, it did hurt - it hurt a lot.  I hate not being able to talk to you or get in contact with you - it makes me feel terrible and I pine and get very agitated.  I want to be with you so much and I can barely wait until that is possible.  I want to hold you close to me and see your face for real and kiss you and tell you that I mean everything I ever say to you.<br><br>Right now I am pining yet again.  I have a couple of free hours as Josh has gone to the cinema with Paul.  I pretended I was ill (which I am a little - this stress is all catching up with me now) so that I could try to find you, but sadly you are not around.  I dont mind though - you have to do things.  I worry if I think you are hanging around for my sake and I am pleased when you say that you are going somewhere, even though I miss you.  I love you so much baby - I really really do.<br><br>So I have managed to get myself back onto the net and now I can send you messages far more frequently.  I have missed being able to read what you send me and being able to write to you when I get the chance.  I am beginning to think this idea of pretending to give my relationship here another go, to buy some time, is a disaster.  I feel so much happier when it is just me and Josh here.  I feel a bit claustraphobic at the moment - practically suffocated - and he is still managing to upset me a lot, even though he is meant to be trying to put things right - some chance!<br><br>I wish you were home right now so that I could phone you and hear your voice - I melt whenever I hear you and no matter how sad or stressed I feel it all goes away when I talk to you.  I am counting the days until I meet you, its going to be so exciting.  I have already planned things - I'm having my hair done the night before and my nails done again next week, so they dont look too nasty.  I'm already thinking about what I'm going to wear - acting like a big baby.<br><br>By the way, when I say about you stalking other women while my back is turned I am only playing - I dont mean it precious.  Not that I have any right to expect you not to, I just dont think that you do somehow.  I am sure that you think I am special and that you wouldnt want anyone else at the moment.  You are far too sweet and sensitive to play games with me, you spend so much time with me anyway, and until you decide otherwise (if you do) I do know that, right now,  you love me, as I love you.<br><br>I can't think of another thing to say.  I am just sitting here feeling a little bit lost and wanting you so badly.  I wish I could be with you right now - I so much want to kiss you and curl up in an enormous cuddle with you - to begin with of course!  There are so many other things that I want to do to you - things that would make you happy, and me too.<br><br>I shall go now Gordon.  I think of you constantly too.  You are my precious baby.  I love you.<br><br>xxxx<br>bye for now<br>I want you so much<br>Love from Kim<br>xxxx<br><br><br>  <br><br>

want to love you forever...
<br><br>hello my angel,<br><br><br>so sorry i missed your phone call last night. i felt really sad when i realised that you had called and i wasn't about. you sounded very disappointed... i'm so sorry... i don't want to upset you... somehow i feel that i have... maybe i'm just being hyper-sensitive... i don't know. i hope that you are okay, really... i wish i could speak with you right now and tell you how i feel... tell you how much i love and adore you... i've been awake most of the night just thinking of you... my heart positively aches for you.<br><br>i'm staring at your picture again... ohhh, you are so gorgeous... awwwwww... i love you so much... i can't get you out of my mind... i can barely describe the effect you have on me... it's such an all-encompassing feeling... i'm so emotional right now... and gazing into your eyes makes me feel incredibly naughty, too... that look of yours is absolutely delicious... it inspires countless dreams and fantasies... *kiss*<br><br>thank you for your adorable email... it was a wonderful surprise to read that this morning... i wish that i hadn't been out so much yesterday... i know you say that i should get on with things, etc... but i missed you so terribly... i lay awake most of last night thinking about you all snuggled up in bed... hopefully you were dreaming of me... hopefully you are happy today... i do hope that you got my text message this morning and that brightened up your morning a little bit... i hope you understand that i spend the majority of my time dreaming and thinking about you... you are always with me, my angel... forever in my thoughts. *hugs*<br><br>i just got your gorgeous little note in the morning post... i like william morris actually... well, i appreciate some of his designs anyway... and i like that print for some reason... thank you so much for finding the time to write to me... it really is beautiful, to be able to read those words in your own writing... and your handwriting is so yummy... i love it... and i love you more, every single day. i can hardly wait to see you. i want to spend countless hours gazing into your gorgeous sparkling blue eyes... you are so beautiful... i could spend an eternity in your arms... and i know that i'll want to.<br><br>it's good to know that you can read my messages once again, and send me your gorgeous words back too... i dusted off my sister's old mobile yesterday, and it kind of works for texting, but not much else... i know, for example, that i can't call out on it for some reason... i'm going to try to put some money into it today... but if it isn't reliable enough i'm going to get a new one... then we can send little messages of love, or tell each other of our desires, whenever we feel the urge... how yummy! *kiss*<br><br>hope to hear from you soon, my sweetheart...<br><br>i miss you so much...<br><br>*warm hugs and passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

yes, you are easily pleased!
Darling baby,<br><br>I am so happy that you liked the little things I sent you.  You are so cute - get all excited like a little child - that's so so sweet.<br><br>I knew that you would never probably get around to going out and buying the CD so I thought I'd let you have mine, I can pick another one up next time I go to Spitalfields market, so it's no problem, and I think that I can live without it for a few weeks until I next go there.  The book is totally gorgeous (I think Genesis P Orrige is a tosser actually!) but it's a lovely book - a real classic bit of pervie text - yummy indeed!<br><br>Yes I did have a good day - I felt happy - I like the night shift as you know, I don't feel pressured to behave in a certain way which I do whenever Paul is around.  He is trying hard to be extremely nice to me but that makes it worse as it happens because then I feel that I should be doing the same and that's just too difficult for me at the moment.  Still - I'm not here to rattle on about him, I'm sure that you have heard enough about all that so I won't go on anymore.<br><br>I am so looking forward to being able to talk to you again later on - can't wait for the time to pass.  I wont stay here and say too much otherwise I'll have nothing to tell you later on so I shall go now.  I love you such a lot baby and I have missed you so much.  I'll talk to you at around 7 o'clock.<br><br>Talk to you soon - big kisses and soppy snuggles.<br>xxx<br>Kim.<br><br><br>

<br><br>hello beautiful,<br><br><br>i'm so sorry about breaking down last night... i know that's not what you wanted to hear... and i'm sorry if i upset you, i just got really emotional and couldn't control myself... very silly i know... quite pathetic really... but i'm human, and i get just as confused as anyone would... i have so many insecurities and things about myself that i'm unhappy with... it can be quite easy to hit a nerve sometimes... anything that anybody else says to me gets easily shrugged-off, i guess... but you mean so much to me, and i love you so much... the very suggestion that i shouldn't speak to you again hit me very hard... i wasn't expecting it... and i know that i did overreact... but i was really emotional already... i'm just sorry for behaving like such a useless idiot... i should be able to cope with all this a lot better by now.<br><br>it seems like i always have to keep you up each night for hours... and i know i don't intend to make you so tired and late each day... our conversations just keep drifting on well beyond your bed time... maybe you should be more strict about when you are going to sleep... i know you say that you don't ever want to leave me, and you know that i'll always stay with you until you say you need to go... but i often feel guilty for keeping you up so late at night... i'm sure it's not good for you... and i hate the idea of you hurting your beautiful ears, because you talk to me on that phone so much... but i know i don't want to speak with you any less either... i always miss you, when you are gone... i'm not helping much here, am i?<br><br>i love you kim, and all i want from you is your love in return... i don't ask for much... only what you feel you can give back...<br><br>you have my heart, and i adore you completely...<br><br>i'm not sure what i should write now... i don't want to upset you again by being too romantic, or annoy you by being too naughty... i'm not sure what to say... you are such an angel... i feel empty when you aren't around... i just want you in my life, somehow... i just hope that you want me too.<br><br>speak to you later, my sweetheart...<br><br>missing you lots...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

no message again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
awwwwwwww - no message from my baby *cries*<br><br>I did get your text message though at lunchtime - no need to apologise but...............<br><br>MY EARS HURT!<br><br>They have been weeping and ever so sore all day - I have been on the phone to you for nearly 13 hours in the last few days and I don't think the new phone is doing me a lot of good.<br><br>I am so sorry that I made you sad, I didn't mean to angel.  I just had to tell you how I felt about things that are very very important to me and I didn't word it very well.  I get a bit embarassed when I have to say these things - I feel awkward and silly (and a bit pushy) so I mumble a bit and say things all wrong.  You then jump to the wrong conclusion and get all upset - then we get deadly silence and I get all the more awkward.  I  must have slept in a really strange position last night too because my neck is really hurting as well *swallows a few anadin*.<br><br>I shall talk to you again later on the phone, but I might use the real one as I am in quite a bit of pain.  I am not looking forward to this weekend - I have lots of schoolwork to do and Paul will be home until Wednesday - urrrrgghhhh!!<br><br>It won't be very easy for me to contact you during that time but honestly baby I shall try my very best.  I do love you and I hate to be away from you for long.  I really believe that we are meant to be together but I just wanted to make sure that you have thought about the reality of this (or rather my) situation, that's all.  I can't, even if I wanted to be, like a 'normal' girlfriend to you, that's assuming that you want me.  This doesn't in any way mean that I don't want you, you must realise by now that the opposite is true.<br><br>Only 3 weeks and 1 day until I meet my gorgeous baby!!!!!!!!! (soooooooo excited already).<br><br>I'm going now - please don't be sad with me - I love you more than I can say Gordon.  With any luck neither of us will need to feel insecure and lonely again in the not too distant future.  I am very lonely too, remember that, and I want to be with you so much it hurts.<br><br>See you later beautiful one.<br><br>I love you<br>xxx<br>bye,<br>K.<br><br><br>

big big apologies
as soon as I sent you that last message, your one to me arrived (a bit slow getting here aren't they?!) - so sorry that I whined!  Should I ever have doubted my baby.  That was a gorgeous message.  One thing though, dont ever be worried about what you say to me.  I love it when you are being very romantic, its not something I've ever been used to and I adore it when you are so loving and sweet to me.  I also love it when you are naughty - I thrive on anything like that - the only thing I feel sure about within myself is anything of a sexual nature (cause I know you're gonna love me in that respect), so please say anything you want - I love you Gordon - you never upset me in a negative way.  I will only become upset if I feel that you are trying to avoid things - dont ever do that.  If you are my baby you will tell me anything.<br><br>Talk to you later precious one.<br><br>I love you<br>bye,<br>Kiss Kiss Kiss<br>xxx<br>K.<br>

feeling lost without you...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i've really missed you today...<br><br>i realise that i've become so used to hearing your voice or reading the things you say to me, that even one day without such reassurance leaves me feelling all empty inside... i probably need to find a way of dealing with this, better than i've done so far... i know that at the moment, we can't always be 'together', and therefore i must learn to cope... but i think of you all the time, so it's difficult... and it seems unfair to say these things, because it might make you think that this is really upsetting me or something... but you said that i should always tell you how i feel and not to hide things, so i guess i'm just writing about how i feel right now... i'm sure this mood will pass... you do make me extremely happy... i suppose this just what it's like to 'come down' from such emotionally high moments... i'd forgotton all about how this feels until now...<br><br>sorry that this message is so bad... i should be writing something beautiful and meaningful... but i just feel a little lost today... i should have gone out, as i intended, but i got up too late again... hopeless, aren't i? ...i was laying under my sheets all morning, just dreaming and wondering... it feels like one of those days when all i want to do is hold you close and cuddle you a lot... one of those silent moments... some things just can't be put into words, and the feelings i have today are like that... all i want is a big hug, that's all... daft eh?<br><br>i found that chat from the end of april... when i asked you to call me for the first time... you're right... i was drinking... my typing was absolutely appalling, but i wasn't so drunk that i didn't realise what i was saying... it's obvious that i was really enjoying myself... so happy to be chatting with you... and that i wanted to feel so much closer to you... otherwise i would never have given you my number... hehe... you said you liked me when i was drunk... that i was cute... awwwwww...  you're so sweet... it's hardly surprising that i fell in love with you... you really are so adorable...<br><br>this message is very late now... as i said, i've had trouble writing today... i can't quite find the right words... i just want to hold you in my arms, feel your warm body next to mine, and hear your comforting words... you are such an angel... i wish i was with you now... i'm going to finish some work now... then i'll curl up under my sheets once more, and dream of you again...<br><br>*big warm hugs*<br><br>awwwwww... i miss you so much, my baby... please write, if you can...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*passionate wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

you make me feel special...
<br><br>hiya sweetheart,<br><br><br>oh, my darling kim... you really are adorable... i feel so much better now...<br><br>thanks for calling me today... it was so wonderful to hear from you again - even if it was only for a few minutes... it sends shivers down my spine whenever i hear your voice... you are so gorgeous... i'm sorry that i couldn't join you earlier on the net... i didn't have a clue that you'd been there for so long... but it was great to be able to chat with you again... and thanks for your sweet little emails too... it makes me feel so special to know that you think of me all the time too... you're an angel... *kiss*<br><br>hehe... i'm still not sure what nari means by 'spinach and bondage' though... hmmm... *wondering*<br><br>so glad you two got on together, she's a real sweetie... she puts on a big confident, bossy act when she chats on the board... however, when i've had a private chat with her, she's always seemed rather unsure of herself... a little naive... and just an eternally curious teenager... but there's no need to feel so protective... she's only ever been a good friend - despite the fact that she's admitted to having a big crush on me... she knows that i'm completely in love with you, and that you make me very happy... she's just a little nosey, as most young kids are... but lots of fun too... she's always been great to talk to...<br><br>anyhow, enough about nari... there's an adorable angel i'd much rather be thinking about... *smiles*<br><br>i'm so sorry that things are being made difficult for you there... that you are having to watch your every move... please don't let his mind games get to you... stay strong, my sweet angel... i wish there was more i could do to help you... it upsets me to know that you feel unwell - as a result of all the hassle you are being subjected to... sometimes i wish i could just pluck you out of that place and give you a big warm hug, tell you that everything is going to be alright... that it's all going to work out fine in the end... then i'd kiss you passionately for hours... and make you feel so much better... i really want you to be happy, my sweetheart... i hope i always make you smile... *hugs*<br><br>i love you so much, my baby... i miss you terribly, whenever we are apart... i'm always thinking about you, and the gorgeous things you say to me... whenever i'm feeling sad, all i have to do is think of your adorable face... imagine your beautiful blue eyes, staring directly into mine... then i'm in a dream... and i'm reminded of all those incredible emotions i feel when we talk or chat with each other... you make me feel so happy... it's indescribable sometimes, exactly what you do to me... all i know is it's the best thing that i can imagine... it's such an all-encompassing set of emotions and feelings... you warm my heart and fill me with joy... you make me feel like the luckiest man alive, when i hear the things you say to me... you are so sweet... i absolutely adore you... *kiss*<br><br>i guess that i must spend today without your sweet words, and your gorgeous voice... i will try to keep myself busy... happy in the knowledge that i will hear from you again very soon...<br><br>i miss you so much, my sweetheart...<br><br>*big warm hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

i will love you forever...
<br><br>hello baby,<br><br><br>here's a bit of that message i wasn't going to send... it didn't sound right, but i know you said that i should always tell you how i feel... so i kept some of it for you to read...<br><br><br>i'm missing you so much... i realise that it's only been one day, but it seems like a week or more... i feel so lonely without your kind words, your gorgeous laughter and beautiful thoughts... i'm so pathetic, aren't i? i should be able to deal with this by now, but i still haven't learnt how to... when we are 'together' i feel so happy... as soon as we are 'apart', i suddenly get so low... how silly of me to say such things... i know that i should have something better to write, than all that nonsense... sorry...<br><br>i hope that you are okay... that things aren't too bad there at the moment... you seemed really upset, the last time we spoke... it hurts me to know that you are feeling ill, as a result of the things that are being said to you... i don't like the idea of you having to cope with all that by yourself... it's just so cruel and unfair, that someone as wonderful as you has to put up with such crap... i really wish i could be with you now... kiss you passionately and hold you tightly in my arms... i love you so much, my angel... i think about you constantly... you are always with me, deep within my heart...  *kiss*<br><br><br>okay... that's from yesterday... since then i've had another gorgeous phone call from my sweetheart... awwwwww... you sounded so gorgeous... making a sneaky call in the school yard at break time... how sweet of you... adorable creature... that made me really happy, my angel... you sounded great, but i know now that you were masking a lot of your worries at the time... *hugs*<br><br>it was good to get to chat with you later on... ohhh... sweetheart... if only i could do something to help you more... i know you said that i made you feel a little better, after chatting with me... but i wish i could do so much more... i really do... i must admit that the idea of going to oxford without you, upsets me quite a bit... but i know you have such a lot to deal with... so i will understand if you can't go... awwwwww... feeling sad again now... i would be so lonely there, without you... maybe i shouldn't go either...<br><br>ohhh... you are so gorgeous... i'm looking at your picture again... i hope you really do like me... because i adore you, my baby...<br>june 30 - it's going to be the most important day of the year for me... and i'm starting to get nervous already...<br><br>thanks for talking with me afterwards too, that was so sweet... even if we got cut off at the end... that was unfortunate... i wish that i'd been able to tell you how much i love you, before you had to go... you have such an incredible voice... it really does have an effect on me... like a warm, comforting glow - rushing through my entire body... sending gorgeous shivers down my spine... and making my heart beat faster... very unusual... but extremely pleasurable too... awwwwww... i love you so much, my baby... *kiss*<br><br>i want you so badly... and i miss you so much...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again, my angel...<br><br>*holds you tightly and kisses you passionately*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

deep inside my heart...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>sorry i didn't write anything yesterday, i just couldn't seem to put anything into words without it sounding stupid... i have been finding it difficult to express my feelings lately... i'm so in love with you, my angel... words just don't seem to fully describe what i feel for you... all i want to do is hold you, kiss you and touch you... for hours... days... weeks... months... years... for however long you'll let me... my feelings for you are so strong nowadays, i get so excited when i hear from you... especially when i can hear your voice... that - at the moment - gives me the most incredible reaction... your voice is incredible... i can't describe what that does for me... and the things you say to me... you are so gorgeous... awwwwww... *kiss*<br><br>it is heavenly to chat with you... even though it's only words on a screen... it's still beautiful... i love reading the things you say to me... and all your delicious, filthy thoughts... you have the ability to get me very worked-up with only a few carefully constructed sentances... hehe... i'm bad... when you write to me, even if it's only a few words, i feel so incredibly happy... i feel your presence always... as if i could close my eyes, and reach out to touch you... i get so close to you... and yet, we've never even 'met' in the real world... although, this will happen soon... then we will know for sure... *hugs*<br><br>all i do know, is that if you still love me - once we've actually met in london - i know i will be yours forever... because i really do adore you kim... i dream about you constantly... you have touched my heart so deeply, and now i never want you to let go... you've made me happier than i've been for a long time... to know that we can be together (possibly), fills me with such joy that i simply can't describe the feeling... it's an emotional rush... a physical and mental reaction, that's so overpowering... i need to just close my eyes and wait.... wait for the feelings to wash through me, before i can even think straight again...<br><br>it was so great to hear you speak to me yesterday... i love your sneaky little phone calls... you always sound so happy and full of energy... i absolutely adore it... you make me feel very special... to call me during the few moments you have at work, just to tell me how much you care... awww... that's so sweet... oh, i love you so much kim...  *kiss*<br><br>so much fun to chat with you later too... twice even!<br><br>hehe... sorry for tearing you away from your work... i know you said that you were only looking for distractions, and that i was far more interesting... but i'm sure it must have been something you really wanted to get done... and then i come and hassle you... oh, how rude of me... anyhow... it was gorgeous, as always... you always make me laugh such a lot... get me feeling very naughty... and make my heart melt with your adorable, sweet thoughts... tonight, i really did want to go to bed with you... desperately... i want you badly... i get very nervous when you go nowadays... because i know i'm going to feel so lonely without you... i wish i could be with you all day and night... i really do... being silly, aren't i? ...i know this can't happen, not really, but i live in hope that one day it might happen. *hugs*<br><br>i should go to sleep now... i'm extremely tired... i was going to go when you did, but i didn't want to leave you without another message again... i will write you another in the morning, when i get up... i'll try to, anyhow... i'm not going to read this one, because i'll just start finding things wrong with it - as i always do... so, please excuse any typing errors... i didn't check for them... *kiss*<br><br>missing you so much, my angel... going to dream about you now... get all snug and warm, under my sheets... and think about what it's like to have you laying next to me...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again... happily, i know it won't be long this time...<br><br>*big warm hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

such a sweet thought...
<br><br>hello beautiful,<br><br><br>i'm really happy now, because you called me not just once, but three times... and each time you sounded absolutely adorable... such an angel... *hugs*<br><br>i'm glad that you decided to go out and meet karen, after all... she sounds really nice and lots of fun... i only wish that i could have been there too... you both sounded like you were really enjoying yourselves... did you spend all the time chatting about me, or did you find time to talk about something else too? oh dear... that sounded rather arrogant didn't it? hehe... actually, you said that you'd been mostly talking about me... that's so sweet of you... i'm sure you didn't bore her atall... she's always been so happy for us both - whenever i've chatted with her online - always wishing us the best...<br><br>you said that i kept going quiet, when i was with you... but that i was chatting fine with karen... well, baby... it's because i love you so much, that's why... i keep getting these moments of feeling: 'oh i wish i could just hold you in my arms right now and kiss you...', that's why i go quiet occasionally... you have such an incredible effect on me... i'm sure you must realise this by now... i only have to hear your gorgeous voice and i'm in a dream... i just want to be with you so badly sometimes that it really chokes me up, and then i can hardly speak...<br><br>awwwwww... you are so wonderful kim... i've just put the phone down... that was so sweet... being able to talk with you, as you made your way home... i felt as if i was almost there with you... and i really wish that i was too... holding you close and gazing deep into your beautiful blue eyes... delicious, passionate kisses on the train back to romford... how incredibly yummy... *kiss*<br><br>so, tomorrow i book my tickets for london... to come down and see you for the day... i'm so excited, already... i haven't felt quite like this for a very long time... such anticipation... only twelve days away... even i'm counting down, now... every time i think about it, i get a shiver down my spine... it's such a yummy feeling, knowing that i'm really going to be with you so soon... i'm sure, as you said, that i'll start to get really nervous on the day... and that won't really wear off until we've actually met... i know that all i want to do is hold you in my arms and hug you tightly... i'll want to do that for quite a while i expect... i've been waiting so long for that feeling... then, of course, i'll want to kiss you... kiss you tenderly on your delicious shiny red lips... and gaze again into those incredible blue eyes of yours... i know you say that i'm very easily pleased, but that moment will make me the happiest man alive... *hugs*<br><br>it's only minutes since we spoke, but already i miss you terribly...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you tomorrow, my angel...<br><br>*warm hugs and passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i've been a very bad boy... i haven't written you one of these messages for an entire week... how rude of me... so i shall try to write every day from now on.  *kiss*<br><br>it was so good to be able to speak with you again last night... every moment i can spend with you is incredibly precious... i sometimes feel that i waste it terribly by going so quiet on you... but i often do feel really happy and yet cannot find the words to express exactly what is in my heart... just being able to talk about anything to you is difficult at times, but this is my own fault and has absolutely nothing to do with anything you say or do... it's just me... being daft...  *smiles*<br><br>in only 5 days we'll be together in london... probably still walking around right now, holding hands... gazing into each others eyes... i hope we are anyway... it'd be ever so beautiful to realise a dream or two on that day... we've waited such a long time to meet each other... it seems like i've known you for a very long time, and yet it's been barely two and a half months. it'll be so exciting to be with you at last... i know that i'm going to adore you even more than i already do... i'm sure that i'll only have to take one look into your beautiful blue eyes, and my heart will begin to pound like crazy... i know that i'll be so incredibly nervous until i know how you feel about me... whether you really want me or not... i hope that you do want me... i love you so much, my angel...  *hugs*<br><br>you are so adorable... last night was gorgeous... i love being in bed with you... hehe... you sound so delicious when you talk to me in there, for some reason... and calling me at lunchtime was so sweet, as ever... you always make me feel so special, so loved and very happy... i really do feel that we were made for each other, my baby... it's uncanny the amount of things we have in common... quite unusual really... but ever so nice too.  *kiss*<br><br>it's nice to know that you are interested in what i do... i wasn't sure if you were or not... but you had such a beautiful way of putting it... something like 'of course i'm interested... it's part of you, isn't it... i'm bound to be interested'... that made me go really funny inside... i get incredibly insecure about things... not just myself, but also the things i do... i'm very self-critical... it's nice to know that others think something of me, and what i do... it gives me hope... and you always give me so much hope... *kiss*<br><br>i'll write you something else later tonight, my angel...<br><br>i miss you so much... can't wait to hear from you again...<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br>

i must be punished...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i'm so sorry... i missed both your calls this lunchtime... i've been kicking myself ever since...<br><br>i overslept very badly today... i spent the night in my sister's old room, because mine was far too hot and stuffy last night to sleep in... i can't open the windows in here because the air outside just makes me sneeze and get all irritable... so i have to make do with a large fan instead... but anyway, because of feeling so crap and everything, i couldn't sleep for ages last night... then i went and slept through my alarm... i didn't wake up until  about 12.30... of course, then i panic... i came and checked to see if you'd called already, and you had... i checked my mobile and got your message from early morning... so i sat for a while, feeling sad and stupid... then i decide that you probably won't be able to call me again... so i went and had a shower... then i came back and i checked my mobile again... and realised that you'd tried to call me again... when i was in the shower... awwwwww... and i realise that i can't send you a message back... and so i just sit down and cry... i really am useless sometimes...<br><br>i'd hate for you to think that i don't want to talk with you, or hear from you... that's the very last thing i want... i'm so sorry my angel... i really do miss you too... so badly... it hurts to know that i missed your calls, and that i made you feel sad... i wish i could speak to you now, ever so much...<br><br>i hope i hear from you soon baby... and that you still want to talk with me...<br><br>sorry this message is awful too, but it's the only way i can think of contacting you at this moment...<br><br>i miss you terribly, my beautiful angel...<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br>

<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>i'm so glad that you haven't vanished... i really thought you had, for a while... i often search in vain for a red 'Bu' on the bored... but it seems that they are even rarer than 'blues' these days...<br><br>i am still here...  :-x<br><br>i have been sending you emails and messages, but i never had any replies... i assumed that you didn't want to hear from me anymore... which upset me a lot... but there seemed to be nothing i could do about it...<br><br>i keep sending email to your bu@micron.net mailbox... does none of that reach you anymore? ...i always send you any half interesting rh stuff i find... and i've also sent a few messages here too... didn't you get any of those? i know this place was seriously buggered for a while... but you still should have got those, i think... did you send me anything to gnp@appleonline.net or gnp@globalnet.co.uk recently? they don't work very well anymore... so i'm going to cancel them... kim sent me some messages and i never received them, they just seemed to vanish into the ether - that was really annoying... i didn't get any email from one for an entire week... i'm only using my mail@gnpdesign.com or .co.uk one from now on...<br><br>isn't technology wonderful?  ;-)<br><br>i'm ever so sorry about your eternal wait for my parcels... i will try to send you some stuff in the post as soon as i can... the fact is that i am very skint, and have been for quite a while... i haven't had much work recently, and have been concentrating on getting my site finished and pitching for jobs in london... because i need to move there sometime this autumn... nari has been waiting for a parcel from me for a while too... i do realise how useless i have been... i guess i should be shot at dawn...  :-(<br><br>i'm suffering a bit with my nose today... it was the same yesterday... it's really hot and dry here at the moment... i can't open any windows in my room, or i start getting very irritable... i really can't wait for it to rain... i'm wishing for a monsoon...  :-S<br><br>how was the rh gig in seattle? i assume that you went to it...<br><br>i'm meeting kim this saturday... and then i see her again next saturday at oxford... i'm just starting to panic today... it doesn't seem to matter how much i am reassured... i'm still rather convinced that i'll be told she doesn't want to be with me... and i don't know how i'll cope with that, if it really does happen... i'm not the type of person who worries... but this feels like such a 'make or break' situation that i'm getting incredibly nervous about everything... we've spent so much time together in the last couple of months... talking on the phone, sending messages to each other and chatting on the net... everything has got very intense, and i don't know if i could deal with losing her now... i never imagined this could happen... so soon... but i really do love her...<br><br>sorry to moan about things... i guess it will work out... somehow... i just never seem to have much luck with love... i know you said that you wanted me to be happy, and hoped i could find someone who could love me too... but i'm sure this has upset you too... i felt completely shattered when you said that you wanted to fade away, into the background... i thought that i'd lost you forever... i realise that i probably don't deserve any of your attention... but i do miss you so much... you have always made me ever so happy...  :-x<br><br>please keep writing to me, whenever you can... i still want to be your friend, if you want me... i will mail you something very soon... i know that you need something from me - something you can hold in your hands - so i will try my best not to disappoint you again... hopefully the website will be up before i go to london... i'll send you a message as soon as it is, because i know that you've been waiting such a long time for that to happen too...  :-S<br><br>byebye for now, sweet angel... you are forever in my thoughts...  ;-)<br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

hey gordon...<br><br>i haven't received anything from you in at least two weeks, probably three.  we had our email address changed, but i sent you an email to let you know.  obviously it was one of the ones that vanished...  :-(<br><br>i am so sorry to hear that you are under the weather with your allergies.  the weather has been strange here as well.. as far as pollen and allergies.  a lot of people having a hard time.<br><br>HEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GUESS WHAT??????????  well.... first of all the Gorge show was incredible.  wonderful.  shattering!  indescribable (did i spell that wrong?????? :-?)  anyway........ guess what i did??  i snuck backstage after the concert and met phil and ed.  no shit.  it was a BLAST!  they were very nice.  the only one that wasnt nice was the bald security guard!  :-S    YIKES!!  anyway.... i will have to tell you more about it later! <br><br>i am finally working for my new clinic and have become insanely busy.  it has been crazy lately.  yesterday i put in at least 14 hours of work.  ugh.  i thought that maybe you had decided to stop sending me email because of kim.  i am glad to hear that is not the case!  i have missed you.  oh hey.... new email address since you didnt get it last time is slbose@qwest.net.  do you have the Q article by chance?  i havent been able to find it and would love to read it.  OH!  and they played the Reckoner at the Gorge!  did you hear the webcast?  i thought of you often during the concert.<br><br>so you meet kim this saturday?  oh MY!  i am sure it will go well... dont worry yourself too much about it.  i have all the confidence in the world that things will work out for you "love-wise".  and if things dont work out with kim, there will be another.  you are brilliant and sweet and there is no doubt in my mind that some lucky girl will find you.<br><br>well........ i should go.  i feel like there is so much to catch up on!  i really thought that you had gone because i told you i thought it was a good idea to fade into the background.  i have missed you!<br><br>please take care of yourself.... get lots of rest and dont get yourself too stressed out about kim.  everything will work out.<br><br>i may try and go on the board again... i must tease carole about having met ed!  i met a boardie at the concert too.... she was nice.  we were upfront in the audience, right infront of ed for the first three songs of the concert.  then they played iron lung and all hell broke loose!  i got pulled out of the crowd and went back to the terrace to watch the rest of the show.  it was absolutely incredible.<br><br>anyway.............  here i go again!  rambling....  hehehe.... "ramblings of a mad woman", remember that?  :-*<br><br>ok....... gotta go.  send me emails!!!!  and my parcel????  hehehe..... the suspense is killing me!  did you still want me to call you when i get it?<br><br>ok..... i am really going now......<br><br>i have work to do.............!!!!!<br><br>one last line.............<br><br>it was wonderful to hear from you.<br><br>:-)

<br><br>hey lisa!<br><br><br>it's so good to hear from you again... i've really missed you... *sobs* you are never far from my thoughts...  :-x<br><br>okay, so everything i've emailed recently must be 'in limbo' i guess... if you can tell me what the last email was that you got from me - before i 'vanished' - i will resend all the stuff that you didn't get...  :-x<br><br>the weather is still dry and sunny here, but it is a little cooler now... kim said that it's been raining in london, so it may be a little more bearable for me when i get there on saturday... i hope it is anyhow... just going there to meet kim is all i need right now to make me get all nervous... she's done all this before - in a sense - a couple of weeks ago... she met karen - from the board - in london... and they called and spoke to me whilst they were in a cyber cafe off bond street... karen is ms nin, and other names... but, of course, this is very different... and the more excited kim has got in recent days, the more nervous i have become... i'm not sure why i'm so panicy... she's done her utmost to tell me how much she cares for me, but... i'm still terrified of being rejected once again... after all this build-up too... i'm sure i'll be completely flattened, if it does happen.<br><br>moaning again, aren't i?  :-S<br><br>the gorge gig sounded really good... yes i did hear the live webcast... apparently some people had black and white scratchy video too... but, not me... i got up very early and listened to it, whilst doing some work on the webby design... i was thinking about you a lot, during the show... wondering where you were... if you were jumping about excitedly like a child... or standing down the front - staring intently - lusting over thom's stubble... :-o<br>i have an mp3 of that new track here, and lyrics... somewhere... i sent a link, but you obviously didn't get it... i think if you check the rh news pages you'll find a link to somewhere that has a decent copy of it though... so... you met the very tall mr o'brien, and the very nice mr selway did you? hehe... very cool... please tell all, whenever you get the chance...  i do have that Q article... i will scan it and send, when i get the chance... it's a big 20 page feature... erm... i'll see what i can do... ;-)<br><br>busybusybusy are you? don't work too hard now...  :-S<br><br>sorry about keeping you on the board last night... i did kinda grab hold of your legs as you were leaving, didn't i? hehe... late-night panics and whatnot... i needed someone - who understood - to tell me that things would be alright... and you helped me a lot... thank you for hanging around for a while... i wish that i'd been able to chat with you, but obviously that was impossible... anyway... you are an absolute angel, and you managed to calm be down quite a bit... fancy calming me down again tonight, or more likely... tomorrow night? ...eek!!!  :-x<br><br>i never want to lose touch with you, lisa... i assumed that you'd done what you said and had left me... i didn't stop wanting to chat or send you messages... quite the opposite... but i also didn't want to hassle you either... i never want to upset you again, or make you feel that you have to stay away from me... that's absolutely not the case, i can assure you... i still love you, and i want to remain your friend forever, if i can.  :-x<br><br>yes, this saturday i meet kim... *panic* :-O<br><br>saturday is going to be either the best, or the worst day of the year for me... she's so sweet, and extremely passionate... i can't wait to be with her... but i know it's going to be difficult for us - even if we do still adore each other - once we've met... things aren't being made atall easy for her at the moment, which upsets me greatly... but i can do nothing other than reassure... i feel rather helpless really... useless is more the word.<br><br>your kind words are very comforting... i'm so glad that you are still around for me... i need all the help i can get, some days...  :-x<br><br>parcel? ...parcels, more like!  :-)<br><br>i have a lot of stuff to send to you, so i will try to mail a package with a few things in by next week... nari is expecting hers too, and if she doesn't get it quickly i'll be in real trouble... *ouch!*  :-o<br><br>thanks ever so much for having the patience of a saint, and for helping me feel a ittle better about everything... i hope that you are happy and not too busy with all that work... i will write you something again tomorrow, if i don't find you lurking about tonight... hehe... lurker!  ;-)<br><br>byebye for now, sweet angel... please keep writing... it means so much to me...<br><br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

I am so excited
Dearest darling gorgeous creature, I love you so much and I cant wait to see you tomorrow - I feel all achey and peculiar right now and I am so desperate to talk to you as I have been unable to talk to you properly for a while now (seems like an eternity).<br><br>I know I keep pestering but I feel so anxious to speak with you and to tell you how much I love you and to hear your voice which always makes me feel all woozy.<br><br>Last night was a very very bad one - the worst yet.  I had a full blown panic attack as it seemed as if all my plans would have to go out of the window.  Paul wouldnt go out and did his usual chopping and changing of his mind - thats why I couldnt talk to you last night.  I was given today off work so that I could sort things out so I made lots of important appointments and then - lo and behold - he rings in sick so it meant that he would be here today and tomorrow - I freaked out totally - more than I had ever done before.  I have had no sleep and I look rough and feel like shit.  One good thing came of it though - I decided once and for all to throw everything at him - the way he has treated me and how it has adversely affected my boy - by the end of it I even had him in tears.  I have had to miss a couple of appointments this morning but he has now left me and gone to stay with his brother in Barnet and he wont be back until Wednesday when he is going to another building society to try one last attempt at buying me out.  I have spoken to my solicitor and he agrees that it would be better for me if he can do this but I must only give him until Thursday to get it moving or else he (the solicitor) will force a sale and the house will be on the market on Friday.  I drove him to the station to make sure that he actually went and he has now gone.<br><br>Fortunately that leaves me free for tomorrow.  I was so worried that I may not be able to come - I couldnt have left my poor Josh here with him all day to suffer but that has now been solved and I shall be there.  This is something that I have wanted for so long and I cant explain how I feel about being able to see you at last.  I am so thrilled about it I cant even begin to express it in words.<br><br>Oxford of course is also sorted out now as my parents are coming to collect Josh on Friday evening and I will pick him up on the Sunday night - that way there can be no chance of being let down at the last minute, which was what I felt was likely to happen.<br><br>Oh I love you so much Gordon - more than I think you know and I cant wait to see you, kiss you and tell you what you mean to me face to face (if I dont collapse and say nothing at all!).<br><br>I shall go now and I shall keep trying to contact you throughout the day - sorry if I'm being a pain but I want to hear you soooooo much.<br><br>Bye bye for now gorgeous baby - talk to you and see you soon xxxxxxx<br>Love from Kim.<br>

<br><br>heya lisa!!!<br><br><br>thanks for writing back again... and i'll never mind how short your messages are... just to have a reply is enough... it means a lot to me...  :-x <br><br>oh my! you sound ever so busy... 1am and still working? eek!!! i think you too need to rest up, drink plenty of water, and spend some time out in the sun...  ;-)<br><br>i just wanted to say that you are such a wonderful, incredible, kind-hearted soul... i'm so glad that you are writing to me again... you've helped me such a lot, with your reassuring words... you always make me feel happy, and so much more positive about things... i often hoped that i'd hear from you again, but somehow i never believed it would happen.<br><br>today was a very strange day... kim had an awful night... no sleep... endless rows... finally, in the morning, her swine partner agreed to move out for good... and she sent him packing... properly this time. she's so overjoyed at having got rid of him... he was really making her ill... i was getting extrememly anxious about what was going on there... her poor son has suffered from similar mental torture too... now they are finally free of it... that's such good news... i know it will take her a while to get over everything, but the worst bit is done with now... i hope...<br><br>we talked all morning together... and spent most of the evening chatting too... i've booked my train tickets to oxford, for next week... and kim has been out to have her hair cut... she said she wants to look her best for me... she's so sweet... i became incredibly paranoid about myself last night... early in the morning i was actually crying over the prospect of her telling me that she really doesn't want me, after all... and i felt so ugly in the morning too... i didn't look atall good today... i think my nerves had taken over a lot... but, she's an absolute angel also... and helped me to feel better about everything again... she insists that she'll adore me whatever... and that i'm everything she wants... i still have a tiny pang of 'maybe' rolling around my head... but it's a lot smaller now... thanks to both you and her... i think everything's going to be fine... for a change...  ;-)<br><br>the reckoner!!! pah pah pahhh!!! yeah... rawk!!! hehe...  :-D<br><br>i'll find the emails that you didn't get and resend them all... i'd love to hear all about the gorge gig, when you have the time... i find the board is nice in moderation these days... i only tend to go there to look for kim nowadays, and drag her into a side room... and i still look for you, of course... often in vain... but it was nice to find you back there the other night... a big surprise... and a nice one too!  ;-)<br><br>thanks once again for your kind words... i would love a big hug too... i'm not sure about sweeping kim off her feet and dazzling her... but she might just like me, quite a bit... and that'll do for me... i will write all about how it goes... i'll write as soon as i come back home... and once i've returned from whatever distant planet i'm on at the time...  :-D<br><br>i'm far too weak to throw rocks into the irish sea, but i did manage a very nice smoothe pebble... i will go and throw in another one - if all goes well - when i return... i think i might be smiling a lot today... she is wonderful, and i love her very much... we get on really well together... did i tell you that we chatted on the phone for over seven hours one night? we usually just talk for about three or four now though... we're a little more sensible about things... hehe...  ;-)<br><br>okay, i will go now and do something to keep me awake until dawn... kim just called me back again, before she went to sleep for a little while... i speak to her again at 5.45am - i'm her alarm call... hehe... it's only eight hours until we meet now... *excited* she is going have a snooze now, because she didn't get any sleep last night... my taxi comes to pick me up in about two hours... i need to have a shower and get ready long before then... *panic*<br><br>you are ever so sweet, lisa... i hope to hear from you soon... and i'd love to be able to chat with you again - properly - at some point... there's bound to be a lot to talk about...<br><br>so, i think my website isn't going to be up this month, after all... maybe after the weekend it will though... it's almost finished... but i'm not going to play with that now, or i really will send myself to sleep!<br><br>byebye for now, my angel...<br><br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

well.... lurked on the board for a moment or two while printing out some work and saw you two lovebirds there.  you sound happy.  i am so glad.  i hope it is everything you imagine.<br><br>i got you emails today!  THANK YOU!  i love reading through the articles... it makes my day to get a nice - non-work related - email.  feels like a present!  so, now what do i have to do to get you to send my parcel?  how much would it be to send it all at once?  i will send you some money... you sound as though you don't have a lot of extra floating around these days!<br><br>now... about that website!!  email me when you are up and ready to go.  of couse i believe i have been saying that for about 8 months now.  god... 8 months.  time flies, dont it?<br><br>well... i had a nice weekend with my parents and niece but unfortunately got hit with WAY too much work.  ended up staying up very, very late most nights.  it was a nice   visit though.  are you going to email the details of your meeting with kim, or would you rather keep that private?  i will respect your privacy, but would love to know how it went.  obviously well, but what was it like first seeing her??<br><br>anyway... i really should be off again.  i am so behind on everything these days.  <br><br>let me know how much the parcel will be and i will send some quid.<br><br>seeYA!!!!<br><br>lisa

<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>thank you so much for your kind thoughts and wishes... i'm sure it helped... i really did need all the help i could get, and i probably still do... i'm so glad that you are happy for me... i hope that wasn't a tear of sadness you were wiping away...  :-x<br><br>do you really want to know what happened?<br><br>well, i don't know where to start really...<br><br>i thought that i should write something... if only, so i can remember it all myself... i haven't told anyone else this much about what happened, and even this isn't everything... i'm only sending this for you, because i think that you really care about me... and you are maybe the only other person who'd understand how two people - who'd never met before - could become so very close...<br><br>grab a coffee... this will probably be a v---e---r---y long read...<br><br>i hope i don't bore you to death... remember, you don't have to read all this... i'm sure i that wrote it for myself really...  ;-)<br><br><br>i was nervous... deadly nervous... i didn't bother going to sleep the night before, so i was tired too... not the best combination really... we'd spoken on the phone and chatted online to each other quite late into the night, and that helped me to calm down a bit... kim managed to get a few hours sleep i think... i sat in my room thinking, most of the night...<br><br>it was quite a long journey to london... it took four hours... i know that seems lightweight to you... but it felt like an eternity to me... i was early for my train at liverpool... the taxi got me there very quickly... i had about twenty minutes to kill, so i wandered around the city centre for a while... walking through the empty streets, feeling the fresh morning air caress my face and cool my mind... i promised that i'd call kim as soon as the train left, because she wanted to get up at around the same time... so i was her morning alarm call... hehe... she was very tired... i felt so bad waking her up after only a few hours sleep... but she was very excited to hear the train moving, and realised that i was on my way to see her at last... she promised to call me as soon as she had left the house for the station... and we kept in touch all the way by sending each other little text messages from our phones...<br><br>i fell asleep a few times... only for a matter of minutes... but i did begin to feel tired after an hour or two... the phone kept going in and out of range, because we were travelling through so many tunnels... kim had to leave a voicemail message instead, which i got eventually... and we were still sending each other text messages - counting down the time until i arrived at euston... i got there much earlier than i thought i would... about ten minutes early in fact... and i wasn't sure if kim would be there already... as the realisation hit me that i was actually in london, my phone rang... it was kim... she was walking up the platform, and wanted to know if it was the right one or not... i paused in my seat for a while... i waited for all of the other passengers to leave first... so now my heart began to race as i started to walk up the station platform... i don't know what i feel anymore... i'm far too over-excited and nervous inside to comprehend anything...<br><br>it was a very long walk... my carriage was near the far end of the train... eventually, as the crowd begins to vanish, i see her in the distance, walking slowly towards me... somehow i just know it's her, even though i can't see her too clearly yet... as we move closer to each other, i see her smiling warmly... i begin to smile too, whilst blushing madly... she looks absolutely gorgeous... her beautiful blue eyes are sparkling in the bright daylight, and the smile on her gorgeous red lips grows even stronger, the closer i get to her... we finally meet... and i can't express what i felt at that moment... it was such an incredible rush of deep emotions... i was all choked-up inside, and found it so difficult to speak... i forget exactly what we said to each other... i think we both said 'hello'... kim looked incredibly relaxed, but realised that i was very nervous... she took my hand, and said 'come on then...' and led me up the rest of the platform... i remember her asking me where i wanted to go, or what i wanted to do... i think i just said 'i dunno... anwhere... anything...', or something... in the quietest voice you could imagine. hehe...<br><br>i remember as we walked up to the arrivals hall that kim said 'you're not as tall as thought you'd be...' and 'you really are 18 aren't you?'... hehe... that really made me laugh... she's been convinced that i'm still a teenager, ever since i sent her my picture. we walked out of euston, a little unsure of where we were going... i said that i was happy to just keep walking... after four hours sat on a train, that's really all i wanted to do... just wander about in the fresh air... it was a beautiful day... absolutely perfect weather... bright and sunny, but with a nice cool breeze in the air... we walked into to the small park, in front of the station entrance... kim wanted to sit down for a moment and roll a cigarette... so we sat together on the nearest bench... she gave me a couple of little bags of sweets that she'd bought especially for me... one had little mouse-shaped jellies in it... and the other had strawberry sherberts in, which she likes too... hehe... we are both little kids, at heart... by now, i really do feel like i'm eighteen years old all over again... i'm still incredibly emotional, and kim kept asking if i was alright every few minutes... in fact, the whole day felt a little like a first date... in a way, i guess it really was.<br><br>i sat and stared at kim as she made her cigarette - a wonderfully intricate operation which i really enjoyed watching her perform, all day long... she kept smiling, whenever we caught each others eyes... and i kept giggling with a mixture of embarassment and excitement, each time she caught me gazing... we stayed until kim had finished smoking... my head was in a spin... every time she spoke, or asked me a question, i went all daft... i kept hiding my face and giggling like a child... i was really silly... but she was so sweet and calm, that i felt incredibly comfortable being with her... somehow it all seemed just right... like it was meant to be.<br><br>we decided that we should go somewhere and have a coffee... i hadn't eaten breakfast or even had a drink before leaving to travel, so we were both thirsty... we wandered for a little while up towards holborn, away from the station... she held my hand as we walked together... that was so sweet... eventually we found an interesting coffee bar along the main road, and went in... kim was incredible fun all day... always poking fun at my 'submissive' nature... telling me to look after her belongings and ordering me about a little... just nice little details, that made me smile a lot... it was really funny in the bar, because an old guy came in and started wandering about rather aimlessly... it was obvious after a while that he was eyeing up kim, which made her burst into a fit of giggles... whenever she saw him looking.  ;-)<br><br>kim did look so gorgeous though... beautiful, auberne, red hair - exactly as i imagined it would be... and she was wearing some of her favourite stuff... a white vest - tied above her waist - with a black and white expressionist painting of patti smith printed onto it... she had a black vivienne westwood jacket over that most of the day, but took it off when she was inside or too hot... she also had on her favourite skirt - a long black ankle-length one by future classics, in an usual vinyl-like material, with a bondage strap at the back to tie it in place tighter... she wore some really nice black stockings, which had a pattern of huge rounded holes in - not really a fishnet type, they had much more material inbetween the holes... and she wore a pair of her favourite black gucci boots - kind of like biker boots, but much more intricately styled and better looking - with big straps and shiny buckles... it all suited her really well... she looked so beautiful. all i wore was a plain black shirt, my black 501's, blazer/jacket and a pair of black, vans trainers - with white trims... i would have worn some shoes or dm's... but i knew if we walked very far, i'd be much more comfortable in trainers... because i have silly feet...  ;-)<br><br>after a while we went to sit outside in the street, because it was nice out there, and i kept bursting into giggles everytime i saw mr pervy gazing at kims tight vest... we sat there for almost an hour, i think... i had plain coffee, and kim had an expresso topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon... she's a cinnamon girl... hehe... i sat and gazed into her beautiful sparkling blue eyes, until she got very self-conscious and i tried to not do it so often... kim took great pleasure in criticising what all the tourists were wearing, and laughing at the city boys in their tiny, open-topped sports cars.<br><br>the more i looked at kim, the more i realised that i really do love her... i think i knew that, the moment i met her at euston... this is why i was so quiet and felt so mixed-up inside... i knew that i loved her, but i was still completely unsure of exactly what she thought of me... all the usual insecurities were racing around my head... it took me another two hours to actually tell her that i love her... i did tell her that she is beautiful, and that she has the most adorable eyes... she seemed to like everything i did say, but i was teetering on the edge of extreme happiness and the most incredible feelings of uncertainty, for most of those first few hours... when kim finished her coffee, we left and continued to wander the streets together...<br><br>i'm not sure if we decided where we were going, i think i just suggested wandering about for a while or going to a park... and kim said we should take a look around soho and the market... i wasn't sure where we were, and we just kept walking about for a long time... we seemed to get lost in holborn... i think we took a wrong turn at one point, and came back to where we had started. we walked constantly for an hour or two, eventually ending up on the kingsway... and kim told me about a sham 69 gig she'd been to, when she was a teenage punk... climbing over a gate at the back of the venue - breaking the heels off her stilettos, and almost both her legs in the process... there was a riot afterwards - apparently most sham 69 gigs descended into riots... anyway... she found a nice little confectionary shop... we went inside and she picked out a selection of her favourite choccies... and she got me a sugar mouse...  ;-)<br><br>kim knew where we were then, and she led me along the streets until we found ourselves in the main shopping areas... we looked in a few windows, and then we went in a vivienne westwood shop down a side street... kim wanted to try on some shoes she's been after for a while... something for her collection... so we stayed in there for a while, whilst she tried on a couple of pairs... but they didn't have any that fitted her well enough, and most of the clothes were rather dull... apparently vivienne's summer collection is always a bit pedestrian... so we left and headed over towards soho...<br><br>kim was getting very tired and hot by now... and was ready to catch the next bus... but after a while we ended up in trafalgar square and we made our way down towards all the back streets in soho... it started to rain as we wandered around... a little aimlessly... but it was fun... we were still holding hands all the while... occasionally arm-in-arm - but as i'm a foot taller than kim, it made walking together a little difficult... so we mostly just held hands instread... and we were chatting a lot less by this point... and i forget what we actually did say to each other... i was still gazing at kim, whenever she'd let me... we had a nose around a couple of the shops selling leather and rubber wear... she picked out and showed me a few corsets, dresses and skirts that she liked... it was nice there... and as she said, it smelt gorgeous too... but it was also very hot in those shops... and i was becoming a little desperate to have a proper chat with her too... we just never seemed to be in the right place... we were very thirsty, and she asked if i wanted to eat, but i wasn't hungry atall... i probably should have eaten something, but i had too much on my mind at that moment...<br><br>we went in the nearest cafe an ordered coffee instead... i don't know why we went in that one though, because it was awful... a tiny little place... my coffee tasted stale, and they put syrup in hers - so it was too sweet... kim kept asking if i was alright... i think i'd given her the impression that i was really fed up or just wanted to leave, because she said 'so how much longer have you got to put up with me now?', 'you're finding this really hard, aren't you?', and 'what's wrong?'... or something like that... in fact, i just wanted to tell her how i felt about her, but it was just wrong in that environment... i was rather shattered from walking so far... and i was also desperate to go to the loo, but didn't want to leave her alone... they kept playing the most appalling music over the radio in that place... every slushy, crappy, dire classic 'our love is over' type of song that's been made in the past twenty odd years... it seemed like a sountrack for two people who's relationship had broken down completely.... and the more i looked at kim, the more upset she seemed to get... kim seemed to have convinced herself that i was feeling the exact opposite of what i really did feel at that moment... and so i just went completely numb, i could hardly speak... i was all choked-up with emotions... i just wanted to take her somewhere else... somewhere she was happy... kim told me off for not telling her that her lipstick had rubbed off... naughty me... so she sat and adjusted her make up, and the appalling music continued... at least that made us both laugh, it broke the atmosphere a little... and kim looks and sounds so adorable when she laughs.<br><br>kim couldn't finish her coffee, so i had mine and then we left... i admitted soon after that i really needed to go to the loo, and she told me off for not saying anything sooner... so i suggested finding a pub, and she said she could do with a proper drink anyhow... we turned the corner and found a nice wood-furnished irish pub, with a nice view of soho from near the bar... we ordered a couple of vodka and tonics, and i went to the toilet... tried to make myself look human again... then came back to sit with her at the window... we felt better then... kim looked more relaxed now... they were playing shane mcgowan and pogues stuff, which we both love... it was a nice atmosphere... we had a really good chat then... everything felt much better... i still wanted us to spend some time together in a park... so she said we could walk over to green park - as it wasn't far - after another drink or two...<br><br>we spent at least an hour in there... it was a very nice place, and we both unwound a little... me especially... i didn't feel quite so choked-up about everything, and i guess i realised that she really did like me... i just needed to hear her say a few things back to me... just to convince myself... i needed her to know that i actually enjoyed being with her, and wanted to be with her even more... we were chatting for quite a while about all kinds of things... the music was excellent and the atmosphere was good... it was really nice... especially because we were laughing so much and smiling a lot... she is incredibly beautiful when she's happy... i began to feel a little more comfortable and comfident about everything... i started holding her hand again, and she grabbed hold of mine too... so i began just stroking her arm a little, as we talked... she didn't move it away, and seemed to like me doing that... so i carried on doing it for a while... i think that kim asked me a few questions, or maybe i just felt that i had to say something... i know i wanted to wait until we were in the park, but i couldn't contain my thoughts any longer... i told her what i thought of her, and that i loved her very much... that i wanted to be with her, if - or whenever - she wanted me to be... and that i'd always be around for her, whenever she needed a friend... i'd be there for her...<br><br>she replied a few times, just enough so i knew that i shouldn't stop... and then she said that she loved me too... !!!!!!!!!... that really did hit me deep inside... i could hardly believe it... i felt as if i was still in a dream... i just never expected any of this to happen... just for those few precious moments, i felt i was the luckiest man alive... i can't express how it made me feel, to hear her say such sweet things about me... i was virtually in tears... i remember that i leaned forward and kissed her arm, where i'd been caressing it... kim really liked that i think... she let out a little pleasurable moan, as i did it... suddenly, i felt ever so happy... and kim seemed really happy too... we finished our drinks, and headed out... it was a pity really, because it was such a nice place... maybe we'd find it again if we looked hard enough... i'm not exactly sure where the place was... maybe kim does... i know it wasn't far from picadilly circus though... i wanted to spend some time in the park, because it was a nice day and i wasn't suffering 'nose problems', which made for a pleasant change...<br><br>we wandered through the bustle of picadilly and made our way over to green park, but we didn't bother walking far... there was a nice area in the shade - not far from the pathway - under some big, old trees... kim is very pale skinned - just like me - and doesn't like been in direct sunlight too much, because she burns easily... and she hates her skin going even slightly tanned... i don't like being in the sun much either, it makes me go funny... but it was nice and shaded under the trees... and it was lovely and quiet too... there was a strong cool breeze in the park, which i really liked... although when the sun went in it did get a little chilly... kim kept making me laugh by shivering excessively every time this happened... eventually we settled down, and kim seemed to want to be as close to me as i did to her... this felt much better, because i'd felt that i was almost forcing my affection on her previously... and i wasn't too sure whether she really liked it, or if she was just trying to keep me happy by going along with it... but, after a while it was obvious that she really enjoyed me holding and cuddling her...<br><br>kim had taken off her jacket and tied it around her waist, when we were still wandering around the shops... so her arms and shoulders were completely bare... she has such beautiful, soft, pale skin...  and i loved holding her and caressing her softly with my hands... she really liked it too, because she began to make those cute little moans again everytime i touched her skin... we were incredibly close now... laying side by side with our arms around each other... snuggling-up tight... our heads resting against each other, staring deep into each others eyes... kim was a little nervous with all this attention i was giving her, i could tell... but considering everything, this was completely understandable... and i never expected her to be so affectionate back to me as she was... we talked a little... i told her how beautiful she was, even though she took a lot of convincing - and still does -  about this... we both do our best to run ourselves down, and need lots of reassurance it would seem - we are incredibly alike in so many ways... i was incredibly self-conscious... and no matter how close we got, i couldn't convince myself that she'd ever want to kiss me... we got up after a while, because it really was getting cold this time... the sun had gone in suddenly... she pulled her jacket back on, whilst i dusted myself down... then suddenly, she put her arms around me and hugged me really tightly... i was almost in tears... i'd been waiting to do that for so long... just to hold her tightly in my arms and give her a really big warm hug... it felt incredible...<br><br>then we looked into each others eyes once again, and i said - half jokingly - 'are you going to kiss me then?', and smiled... then she moved closer and kissed me on my lips... oh, that felt really good... then she kissed me again... and this time, she really did kiss me... i couldn't believe it... i felt my body rush with the most incredible feelings... we hugged tightly again... for a very long time... then we lay back down together - side by side - and faced each other... i forget how this started, but we began rubbing our noses against each other... it was really beautiful... we were giggling like teenagers on a first date... it was all very strange, but so wonderful too... kim wanted me to lay down and close my eyes... she was feeling bossy now... i didn't have a clue what she was going to do to me... then i felt her licking inside my ear, and it made my entire body shiver... no one has treated me like this for a very long time... it was so gorgeous... she continued this for a while, until i really started wriggling, because it was tickling me so much... then kim got me to lay back again and she began kissing and licking at my lips... i couldn't resist not joining in... i was in a dream by this point... everytime i got my tongue between her lips she bit it... she likes playing... and it was absolutely delicious... eventually i managed to kiss her really deeply, and she really liked that... we held each other tightly and continued kissing for a little while... kim was giggling because i was covered in her lipstick... but she had none on her face atall... it had all gone on me... it tasted lovely too... bright chanel red... i forget exactly which colour, but kim did say that it was one that you can't get anymore... she's quite upset about it too, because it's her favourite colour...<br><br>kim made me stay laying down on the grass with my eyes shut, whilst she teased me mercilessly, running her nails over my soft skin and pinching me tightly... she enjoyed slapping me, when i didn't stay still, or if i cried out a little... although i don't think she believed that i could hurt her, if she wanted me too... she gave me her finger and told me to bite it hard... really hard... when i actually did, she pulled it out of my mouth rather fast and screamed a little... hehe... i always do what i'm told though... we spent a while like this... just cuddling and playing gorgeous little games... caressing each others faces and skin... it was absolutely blissful... then we laid together, close again, and chatted about things... we spent another half an hour in the park, but decided that we needed to find a way back to euston quickly... as there was only an hour left before my train was due to leave... just as we were about to go, the sun came out brightly again - just as it was when we arrived... hehe... so, we walked back up picadilly... i think at first we were going to catch a tube train... but there were so many taxis flying by that we decided to get one of them instread... i flagged one down and we got in and headed back to the station... we held hands all the way back, and smiled each time we glanced over and caught each other eyes...<br><br>we got to euston with about half an hour to spare, so we went and sat in the coffee bar and had another drink together... those last minutes were difficult... i wasn't sure how i'd react to having to leave kim behind, but i know it didn't feel good... she looked rather upset too... we just sat and stared at each other, and held each others hands tightly... every so often we'd glance over at the arrivals board to see if my train had come in yet... when it did arrive, kim suggested walking over onto the platform together... there was only about five or ten minutes left before it was due out again... here's something you might be interested in, or maybe not... but... i first chatted to kim on friday 13 of april... and i met her first on platform 13 at euston... i also said goodbye to her on the same platform when i had to leave... strange eh? probably just a weird coincidence though...<br><br>that final walk together was terrible... i had to fight back the tears as we made our way over to the platform... i held her tightly in my arm as we walked up to my carriage, which was at the far end again... then we had to say goodbye... it felt awful, i can't even remember what we said to each other... i know it's not so terrible because we are constantly in touch... kim even calls me during her lunch break at school every weekday - just to say hello and see if i'm okay... and we knew that we'd be meeting again at oxford within a week, so that lessened the anguish a little... but at that moment, when i had to actually go, it made little difference... i just held her tightly in my arms and we hugged until i couldn't stay any longer... we said a final goodbye and kissed again... then i got onto the train, just before it was due out... kim walked back immediately... i don't think she wanted to stand and wave... and i was already in tears by that point... so we parted immediately... i found my seat and sat for a while... trying to stay calm... thinking about all the wonderful moments... i got out my mobile and began to type kim a message, thanking her for a wonderful day and telling her how much it meant to me, and how much she means to me... the train began to leave, and i was trying to concentrate, and type out the words correctly... but after a while i couldn't stand it anymore... and i had to go to the toilet and lock myself in there for a while, whilst i cried my heart out...<br><br>i finished the message and sent it... ten minutes later kim sent me a reply... thanking me for coming and making her so happy, and telling me that she loves me too... that was very sweet... i calmed down after that... i pulled out my sweets that she'd given me and began sucking on some of the strawberry sherberts... we sent more messages to each other on the journey back... kim had to go over to her brother's place to collect her son... and she stayed there a while for a drink... when i finally got home, kim called me on the phone to make sure i was alright... we went and chatted on the board and aim for a while... kim was just a little drunk... and was enjoying herself greatly, by starting arguments with a few of the more serious radiohead fans - who seem to spend their lives on that board... i stayed out of the way... i just said hello to karen, because she was asking if we were both okay and if things had gone alright... then kim was very tired, and i was too... i'd almost forgotton that i hadn't slept for about 48 hours... and kim hadn't had much sleep either, so we just had one more little chat on the phone and said goodnight to each other... i think we finally decided to sleep at about 2 am, eventually... and that was the end of our day together.  ;-)<br><br>i don't think kim's particularly sure what she wants, or exactly what she's thinking these days... this is all very new to her... she has never been treated like this before... well, not since she was terribly young... and so all this affectionate attention came as a bit of a surprise i guess... everything is still unsure really... she needs a lot of time to herself, and for her son... they both need space to sort out their heads, after the constant mental abuse they've had to put up with for years... nothing will really be certain until kim has found somewhere new to live and has managed to sell the large place she's living in now... but she knows that i'm a patient person, and that i care for her very much... so we just have to take everything as it comes... and see what happens... all i do know is that kim still loves me, and that i love her... and that's the best feeling in the world... she made me happier than i've been for quite a long time... i'd almost forgotton what this was all like... i'd virtually given up bothering with love completely... i didn't think i deserved that in my life somehow... i assumed that i was destined to be alone forever... i'm so glad that she's managed to make me realise just how special it all is... it's a truely magical moment when someone says that they love you, and you can see by the look in their eyes that they really mean it too...<br><br>you always told me that i'd find someone special, who could give me what i need... and i really didn't believe it was possible... certainly not this soon, or in this way... kim's still not sure if she can give me what i need... she recognises that i am a highly emotional, pasionate and very romantic person... and right at the moment this all feels like something completely new to her... something very unfamiliar... we've had a few chats on the net and phone since saturday, where we've discussed many things... i've done my best to reassure her about my feelings and intentions, and make sure she understands that i really mean everything i say to her... kim has tried to stop me from getting all insecure and mixed-up about her lack of certainty about everything... she has barely spent three days in this new situation of hers - being alone with her son, and not having to fear someone - she can't bear to be around - wandering in through the front door every five minutes... i think that once she's sorted out this business of moving house, and finally severs all ties with her ex, she'll be able to calm down a lot more and see things a little more clearly... she's a lot stronger now than she was before...<br><br>we are still going to see each other regularly, until she moves... i can always pop down to london for a day or two, as i've already done... then, maybe one day - in the not too distant future - there might be an even bigger place for me in her life, than there already is... all we can do is wait and see... i'm a patient boy, and i don't mind waiting for someone who's very special to me...<br><br>if you read all this lisa, then i think you deserve an award... i will definately send you some pressies soon, and please don't worry about the cost... it will get sent... hehe...  :-D<br><br>please write back a reply, or anything really... just a few words of reassurance will do...  and i always love hearing about what you've been up to, and what you are thinking about too... you are an absolute angel... and you help me such a lot... possibly more than you've ever realised... it's always a great pleasure to receive a message or email from you... and i hope that at some point we'll be able to chat to each other again... i do miss having someone, who really understands me, to chat to properly... and i miss talking about miles and mingus too!  ;-)<br><br>i hope everything's fine with you, and that your work isn't taking over your life... *hugs*<br><br>lots of love...<br><br>gordon.  x x x x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>oh, thank you for being so kind... i'm glad you liked what i wrote... i'm sure if i'd read it as many times as you did, i would have made a much better job of it... you read it three times??? i was thinking even one read deserved some kind of award, never mind three!  :-o<br><br>i know that one thing i left out was about how gorgeous kim smelt on that day... she wears this adorable perfume called 'angel'... and she really is an angel, so it suits her perfectly... i still have a little of it on my shirt, that i wore... it smells so wonderful... everytime i sniff it, i'm reminded of a very special moment... and i'm not going to wash it... isn't that silly? hehe... love has turned me all daft... kim thinks it's rather worrying the way i keep hold of things (saving chats and text messages, etc)... according to her it's very sad - yet quite sweet too, in a strange kind of way... but then, she likes the fact that i'm not 'normal', and have my own little peculiarities... it's something that attracted me to her too... you could never describe kim as atall 'straight'... she's very exotic, extremely naughty, and has excellent taste... we share a lot of likes and ideas... it's rather unusual to find someone who seems to be so well-matched... each time we discuss something i'm surprised at how much we have in common... there doesn't seem a lot that we disagree on completely.  ;-)<br><br>now, lisa... there's really no need to be sad... you are still very much in my thoughts, and will always have my love and as much of my attention as i can give... we agreed to be friends, and i intend to remain your friend forever... we've experienced and shared far too much for me to ever think of you as anything less than completely wonderful... you are very sweet, and have always been more than kind to me, in every way... it makes me so happy to be able to read your adorable messages once again... and you've always been welcome to call me and have a chat... you know that i always wished - at some point - we'd be able to do that... it's a very nice thought... maybe when i've mailed your stuff out to you, you might call me to say hello... that'd be lovely. *kiss*<br><br>you poor thing... you sound really overworked at the moment... i don't know how you manage to cope with it all... hopefully you won't have to be doing this much work all the time... it would really do me in, i'm sure, if i had to go back to doing 13 hour shifts again... please don't worry about sending money for you parcels... i will be able to send them to you without any problem, i'm sure... i hope you have a nice holiday tomorrow... and you get some nice weather too... it was all thunder and lightening here tonight... yummy... it's been raining very hard too... i guess it kinda makes up for a week of constant hot weather... phew!<br><br>i will tell you all about oxford when i return... it should be lots of fun... i don't think that me and kim will be able to stay together all the time, because she is going with her nephew really... and it was all arranged before i met her, so she feels obliged to look after the boy now... i don't mind though... it was going to be a great experience anyway... being able to see kim again - and so soon - will make it a very special day... she makes me ever so happy... i can't begin to describe how all this feels... i just don't have the words to express what i feel inside anymore... it's just such an all-consuming and incredible set of emotions... i never believed that something so wonderful could happen to me... i suddenly feel very lucky, for a change.  :-)<br><br>thanks again for writing to me... please keep in touch, whenever you can... it's always very exciting to hear from you.<br><br>byebye for now...<br><br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

*i heart colin*
<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>you are so sweet... i got all three of your messages this morning... thankyou angel... yes i'd love any radiohead stuff you have... please feel free to send anything you've got... and i know all about south park... "oh my god, they've killed kenny!!!" hehe... be lots of fun to see radiohead and cartman together at last! ;-)<br><br>hehe... have i lost all respect for you? ...never!<br><br>you sound like you had lots of fun at the concert, and really enjoyed your little backstage 'adventure'... hehe... 12 year old!!! no, seriously... i'm sure they really appreciated you saying those things to them... they are very nice people, and they like that kind of thing... and phil is a very very very nice man.  :-)<br><br>hey, i didn't realise - or i simply forgot - that it was your anniversary... happy anniversary!!! (hehe... late again!)  ;-)<br><br>i don't think i'll be venturing backstage after the oxford show... not unless i pass out from the extreme heat. it will just be my luck if there is no fresh air about on saturday... i woke up this morning to find myself swallowing blood... *faints*  :-S<br><br>oh, a little bit of excitement here... kim got tickets for the belfast gig last night... i told her that the gig had been confirmed, because she said she wanted to go to that one... kim was kinda desperate to make sure that she had them before they sold out... i think kim really wanted another gig to look forward to, because she was so used to going out and gigging before... now she is complaining of boredom a lot... and is fearful of becoming extremely 'sad'... spending her evenings in the house, sitting in front of a screen and chatting to people she doesn't know... anyway, we found out from the 'bored' that a concert promoter was already selling tickets on their site, ahead of the 'rush' this morning... so... kim went and got three, because she's sure that her son will want to go too... (that bored place does have some uses after all)... unfortunately the gig is 'on a friday'... so, she will have to find a good excuse for not being at work... we may still not get there after all... i know that i wouldn't go without her... anyway, we'll see....<br><br>kim is really shattered. she had to leave school at lunch yesterday, and has been told to take a week off... i think that everything is beginning catch up with her, and she is having to take mild tranquilisers to get her to sleep now... unfortunately, they are making her rather woozy during the daytime, and she was not at her best yesterday. kim really wanted some time off from work to sort out the house-selling/buying situation, but she didn't want to ask them for the time off, because she hates letting people down. anyhow, yesterday she felt unable to cope and the head told her to go home and take the week off. so, she's spending her daytime now viewing houses... she's going out with her ex on friday night to discuss things - because she won't have him at home, causing confrontations - and she hopes to have a definate answer about what he's going to do about the house. i think once that decision is made, she'll be able to calm down a little and get on with organising her life... which is all she really wants right now... just to get a new place for her and her son to have a bit of peace and quiet in.<br><br>i'm talking too much about kim again, aren't i?  ;-D<br><br>oxford is going to be a bit strange actually... i'm going to have to stay there overnight, because there are no trains after the gig until 10 in the morning... so i'll just have to hang about in oxford until the morning i think... maybe i'll find a few 'bored' people to natter with until the early hours... i know that karen is going with mel... and there's bound to be others about too... kim did say that i could stay with her and her nephew in their room, but i don't want to impose myself on them... dan split with his girl last week, whom he was meant to be meeting there... and the gig is really his birthday present from kim... so i don't want to get in the way too much, or make her feel uncomfortable... i'd hate kim to feel torn between having to take care of us both... none of this was planned as something for us to go to together... it will just be nice to be able to see each other again - so soon - and also to have someone really special there to enjoy the gig with. if i wasn't such a 'novice', as kim likes to call me, i'd have booked a room too... she booked hers a week before the tickets even went on sale... you see, she's a real pro at this type of thing...<br><br>okay, i will stop talking about kim now...  :-)<br><br>webby webby webby... thing...<br><br>it's still being done... a lot of fine-tuning... and i've been working quite hard to make sure that it all does as it says on the label, before i let others inside to see... many little tricks have been learnt during the past... eek! year? ...oh, and i found most of the pages from my old site, that i'd kept - for some bizarre reason - backed-up on a disk... so i might put that up somewhere, and have a link to it frrom the new one... just so i can prove how much better i am at all this web design stuff...  :-D<br><br>i'm going to write you a nice new letter to go in your first parcel... i destroyed the others... it didn't seem right to send them anymore... but i still want you to have something that i've written - just so you know that i do really exist, and that i am what i say i am - because i'd like us to continue writing to each other, and it's nice to be able to read someone's thoughts in their own handwriting - rather than just as pixels on a screen. *hugs*<br><br>as for now... a nice hot shower awaits me, and i need to go wandering off into town... so i'll send this message to your inbox, and look forward to another yummy message from you soon...<br><br>thank you for writing to me again... you always make me very happy... you really are an angel...<br><br>byebye for now... *squeak*<br><br>lots of love... x x x x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>you do well not to encourage me too much... i'm a bad boy... lots of trouble...  :-S<br><br>i did get to bed at 2 am, which is pretty good for me... kim stayed up until sometime after 1, chatting with me on the phone about things... yeah, i've managed to keep kim up far too late before now... one night we were on the phone for over seven hours... haha! ...it's okay though now, things have cooled considerably since we met in london... there's not so much desperation involved in our chats, and kim's home life has improved immeasurably since 'it' has moved out... the uncertainly about what happens next is still there though...<br><br>kim is spending today sorting a few things out, and tonight she has to meet 'it' to hear his decision about the house... why he can't just call her - i have no idea - and neither does she... he's been acting really strange recently... on wednesday she got home to find him at the house going through her drawers, and he accused her of having an affair again... this is after he claimed he was staying with a girlfriend... now he says he only said that to make kim jealous! ...the guy has seriously lost it i think, if he ever had it. i hope that it all goes okay for kim, and he doesn't start causing even more trouble for her... she could really do with a break from all this, although she sees everything with a little more clarity these days.  :-)<br><br>she met a  guy yesterday who does palm readings. she was looking around his house, as it was up for sale... the house was okay she said, but he was more interesting... told her a few things that made her feel much better... just very obvious things that i've said for months... but coming from such a good-natured stranger, she found what he said rather comforting... kim tends to regard such things with a pitch of salt, as i do... but she said he had a really positive effect on her, and made her view the times ahead with a little more confidence... he does phsychic healing too apparently... maybe i should see him too... myself and kim share a lack of self condence in much of what we do, and how we see ourselves.<br><br>anyhow... about your parcel... unfortunately i won't be sending it today, because i didn't manage to get that 'later' tape copied... so i will either do that tonight, or - seeing as how it's oxford tomorrow - i may do it on sunday night and send the package on monday morning... then hopefully i will be able to tell you that your first parcel has been mailed and also that my website is up at last... i should be able to send the rest of the radiohead bits in another parcel, probably the week after... there's still a few things i need to finish off for you... some concerts, interviews and a b-sides compilation... oh, and another video too... it might all fit in one parcel... i'll try to send that all together anyhow.  ;-)<br><br>i've kinda been concentrating on the site this week... i do want it finished by monday and up on the web... then i can concentrate on finding some new work, because i've had so little of that recently... hopefully the website will help make everything easier... i need to get some contacts in london, in order to move down there and work... so that's all to be done in the next couple of weeks...  :-o<br><br>i hope you can manage to get a little break from your hectic shedule to write or say hello now and again... i like this constant communication we are having at the moment... it's really nice... and you are very sweet.<br><br>bubye for now... lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

imnotherethisisnthappenning...
<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>i've rested my head and body a bit, since returning from oxford... hope that you are well, and not too overworked again.<br><br>ummm... where to begin?<br><br>okay, well... i don't know what i expected, but it wasn't like anything i could have predicted... sometimes i am just plain daft, and yesterday i think i really outdid myself in that department... but things seemed to fall apart before i'd even left... i don't know if i should be writing this now... i still feel pretty messed-up about it all, and i have a lot on my mind right now... so, i won't go into great detail... i'm not actually sure i can remember them all too well... although i'll probably end up writing far too much anyhow...<br><br>i got to oxford late, because my train was delayed... kim was not able to meet me, because her nephew had - for some unknown reason - relied on his mum to buy him a train ticket, and she bought him a late ticket... kim and dan tried, but couldn't get anything earlier - as all the trains were fully booked... i do remember saying all this last week when i booked mine though, and was told that dan was 'sorting it himself'... anyway... so i have no-one to meet me, and i down to the park alone - well, in a crowd of others actually... i decided to go in the last pub along the route, just across the road from the park... because i wasn't sureabout what it would be like once i was inside... i had a couple of vodka and tonics before last orders (they closed at 2 pm when the gig started)... then i decided it would be sensible to go to the toilet before i went over to the park... whilst freshening up, suddenly my nose starts bleeding... and i mean really bleeding... i couldn't stop it... i was stuck in that place for about an hour trying to stop it from bleeding... eventually i did, but i was seriously fed up by that point... it seemed rather ominous... and it was i think...  :-(<br><br>so, eventually, i get inside the park and try to find karen... as she's the only other person i know who's there i can contact... karen had gone with melanie (from the board) to queue up outside at 7.30 am!!! so they'd both got special wriistbands to get inside the front enclosure... karen stayed with me for a bit, and had something to eat whilst we waited to hear from kim... but after about an hour of waiting around, karen decided she had to get back to the front, or lose her place in the enclosure... i didn't hear from kim - except for a couple of short text messages on my phone, when i was making my way to the gig - until another hour or so... she'd asked me to keep my phone on all the time, so she could contact me... but managed to keep hers switched off all the time... so i could only reach her by sending text messages... anyhow... moan, moan, moan... sounding selfish now... but i didn't know what was going to happen here... she was bringing her nephew to the gig as a birthday treat... and she didn't seem atall sure - when we'd talked previously - what she was going to tell him... or what she was going to do, once we were together... she feared it was going to be awkward... and it really was...  :-(<br><br>cutting a long story short, i eventually found her sitting on the grass - outside the waste tent - with dan... but as soon as i got there i felt uncomfortable... what do i say, what don't i say? etc... and i was still rather fed up with suffering from the weather and having to wait so long to meet up... i saw a few good bands before they arrived, but it would have been better had someone been there to share it with me... kim and dan had spent most of the previous couple of hours drinking in local pubs... i was feeling seriously like a stranger by the time we met up... kim didn't seem to want to be close to me atall, so i guessed that dan had little or no idea who i was... it made things very difficult, because i felt i couldn't do or say anything right... when we talked on friday night, kim seemed rather more positive... her ex had offered to buy the house, and so things seemed to be moving for her, and working out much better... but as soon as i met kim she told me that she hadn't had much sleep the night before, because her ex had turned up at the house in the morning and insisted that he was coming to stay again, seeing as how he was buying the house, etc... so she was already really nervy, as a result of this needless confrontation... and this is on top of a rather fraut meeting on friday night too... she spoke about it as if it wasn't such a big problem and that she'd just have to move into somewhere temporary until the house had been sold... but i knew she must have been feeling really annoyed by this, and i wanted so much to comfort her and discuss things... but i couldn't...  :-(<br><br>so, i have to sit there... virtually numb... throughout the whole of the 'supergrass' and 'beck' sets... and all i'm thinking about is what the hell do i/can i do/say... i really did feel like a complete stranger... there were moments when i felt just happy to be able to be there with her... but it was even worse than the most awkward moments in london... it really was 'look but don't touch'... and i really felt like i couldn't cope with this tension... dan is a typical grow-up teenager... always joking and giggling about everything... and he made kim laugh and smile a lot... which was a good thing - seeing as how i was completely lost in the whole situtaion... whenever we were alone for a few moments - when dan wandered off for a while - kim mostly just asked me what was wrong and 'are you okay?'... it felt a bit like those really difficult moments in london all over again, only this time i couldn't respond atall... i was just mumbling 'nothing, i'm okay...', when i was cearly not okay atall... but i couldn't tell her what was rolling around my head, or show any emotion whatsover... so it felt really bad inside... i just really wanted to hold her... i wanted that so much... but i knew i had to keep away... and i didn't want to give her yet another thing to worry about... so i just kept it all inside... well, i tried... of course, it was surely written all over my face... the longer i was with her like this, the worse it got... and then more she asked me if i was okay or not...  :-S<br><br>it began raining for a while, during 'beck'... so we all got thoroughly soaked... kim was rather annoyed because she'd only come with a t-shirt and jeans on... dan only had a jumper over his top too... kim was going to wear a pvc top... but at the time when they were leaving their room, it was still sunny and warm, so she assumed it would stay that way and that she'd get far too sweaty in it... now she was rather regretting the decision... anyway, the rain stopped and we all looked pretty wet... we wander off to the dreaded beer tent to get something to drink... i can't describe how terrible it was there... a crush, basically... a really badly organised shambles... it took us over half and hour or more to get something... and we had to fight our way in and out for them too! ...myself and kim got out of the crush, whilst dan was trying to get more drinks... i think this was the most time that we had together... about ten or fifteen minutes whilst we waited for dan to reappear... she told me that he knew nothing about us meeting previously and who i was, other that being a friend from the messageboard... i told that i'd realised that... and we chatted a little more about what had happened that morning for her... she told me that she might actually have to stay at home with her ex, until he'd bought her out... because she feared if she moved out that he'd just delay everything deliberately - just to be awkward...  :-S<br><br>so, now i'm quite depressed... we find dan again and sit back in our spot... she was rather anxious of losing the boy in the crowds too, which added to a lot of the tension... but we all stayed together after that... i began to feel it must be rather starnge to have me follwing them around all the time, but as soon as i said i would bother going somewhere with them... kim said 'come on...', so i continued to stay with her... we got something to eat before radiohead came on... dan was hungry for junk food... but because of a short queue, kim dragged us to a vegan/vegitarian place, and we got something from there instead... we wandered forward, so we were halfway into the main crowd around the stage... but we weren't crowded... we also had a good overview, and could see the large screens very clearly - beaming footage back from the stage... kim wasn't particularly interested in 'seeing up thom's nose', as she put it... and wasn't too bothered about being near the front... it was loud enough from were we where anyhow...  :-O<br><br>so, the gig... it was good actually... despite all the tension between myself and kim, and the band saying how nervous they were between songs... they opened with 'national anthem'... all the really strong upfront tracks came across really powerfully... and many were vastly extended versions... they messed up the start of 'airbag'... i don't know what went wrong, but i saw phil stop playing and burst into hysterics at colin... then thom said very loudly 'oh bugger!'... then they tried again... it was really good after that... kim got her wish to have 'my iron lung' belted out really loudly... 'pure class...', as she put it... and she enjoyed jumping about to the more upbeat tracks... my favourite moments were the ear-piercing rackets that ed got out of his guitar at the end of 'dollars and cents' and 'idioteque'... 'i might be wrong' was the one that i thought sounded best live... that and a really mad 'idioteque' were the ones that i couldn't avoid jumping about to... thom dedicated 'paranoid android' to geri haliwell, because he'd shared the train journey back from paris with her... that got him a barrage of whistles and woops... and it was drizzling so much, that i was sure it would begin to monsoon down during 'rain down...', but it didn't... i'm not too sure about the rest of what they played, or any other comments... it really all flew by incredibly fast... thom kept saying they were nervous, and he dedicated 'you and whose army' to 'tony'... but by that point kim was getting seriously pissed off with my 'total silence', and kept glaring at me... and asking me what was wrong...<br><br>at the end of a really good version of 'karma police' - sung by the crowd at the front in perfect harmony... dan had vanished again to another food stall... and kim said 'that's the one i like to play when i get angry...', then she looked and growled at me 'you really are annoying!' and 'is it really so difficult?'... and, of course, i couldn't even speak now... i was completely choked-up inside... i didn't want to say anything, because i knew i'd just break down completely... and i knew that dan would be back in a moment... so i had to just stop looking at her and shrug it all away... but i'm sure by now that she knew i just wasn't coping with this atall... and i'd started to really irritate her... because i'd become another 'problem' to deal with...  :-(<br><br>the band were ending their first encore with 'how to disappear completely' as the rain really did start... and i mean it really poured down... withing seconds we were completely drenched... and i was listening - with some kind of strange amusement - to thom singing 'i'm not here, this isn't happening...', as the water completely soaked me to the bone... dan had run for cover at the food stall again... i looked into kim's eyes - as she began rubbing at them - and she said 'you can't stay out in this all night... do you want to come and crash in our room?'... for that one moment, i was really happy... i don't know why she offered really... because i knew it would be so incredibly awkward to stay with them all night... but it didn't matter, because all i wanted at that moment was someone to care a little bit... it's an incredibly selfish thing to say, but it's true... her original plan was that she would stay with me that night and leave dan to sleep in the hotel... but that idea quickly vanished, the closer it came to the day...<br><br>we decided to leave after the first encore was over, because we were getting seriously drenched by this point... kim was also shivering and freezing cold... and although i offered to give her my jacket a few times, she wouldn't take it off me... if i'd been alone with her i would have held her in my arms tightly all the way back, and kept her warm... but i couldn't touch her, so i had to just keep asking how she was instead... her eye make-up was beginning to sting, and she was rather desperate to leave by now... dan, of course, thought the rain was brilliant -  even though he was just as soaked to the skin as the rest of us... when we got out of the main gate, we stood and watched the remaining encores from under a tree... having decided that we couldn't get much wetter anyhow... they did 'talk show host' and 'the bends', i think... then thom started to play 'motion picture soundtrack' which we assumed was the last song... but he stopped it very quickly... about a minute later he came back out with the band and said something like 'we're going to do this instead... this is a very old song...' ...then they launched into 'creep' and the crowd went mad... it was a really strong version... very passionate... i don't think they've done that live since about 1998... and once again i was struck by the words 'what the hell am i doing here... i don't belong here'... it summed up by emotions completely at that moment...<br><br>i should say that it was fun, for a while... wandering about in the rain, listening to the end of the gig... but we managed to get out of the park eventually... and began the long trek back up the to guest house that kim and dan were staying in... it never stopped pouring down all the time... and it took us around half an hour just to walk back to the place... when we got inside, we were completely sodden... dripping our way upstairs, trying not to wake anyone up... i said i'ds just stay in the armchair and let my clothes dry on me... which they actually did eventually... kim and dan put their wet things in the bathroom, but they never dried... we had some coffee and dan kept kim smiling until we turned out the lights...<br><br>i was kind of resigned to the situtaion by that point, and just tried not to irritate kim too much by looking sullen or being too silent... i remember looking over to her a few times and smiling, and seeing her smile back... we didn't completely lose that contact i guess... but kim was very self-conscious of how she looked, after being caught in the rain... i remember when we got wet during the 'beck' performance she said 'well now you've seen me looking like a mess...' and 'do i look really awful?' etc... and, of course, she didn't... i don't think she understands that i love her whatever... but i'm sure that - given the opportunity - she wouldn't have wanted me in that room with her that night...<br><br>when we woke in the morning, kim began to get rather snappy with me...i tried to keep out of the way, until they both dressed... and did what i could to help her... but it was obvious that she wanted me out of the place as soon as possible... and kept asking me when i was catching my train, and when i was going to leave... i think i checked to see if my jacket had dried, and it had a little... i think most of their stuff was still incredibly damp though... my body heat had dried my clothing during the night... kim had to put on her pvc top, because her t-shirt was still soaking wet... she was now becoming really uncomfortable having me around the place... i think i went to the bathroom to freshen up a little... then i checked through my jacket to find my tickets and stuff all stuck together... i turned to look at kim, as she was standing brushing the knots out of her hair... i was going to tell her that she looked really good, which she did... but she turned and snarled at me 'what are you doing? ...you keep checking through your pockets, aren't you going to leave?' ...i'd say dan would have to be rather dumb not to have sussed something by now... the way she was talking to me, was not they way someone would talk to someone they'd only just met... but she seemed completely fed up with me being around her now... so i just collected my things and said that i was going, and headed back out into the rain...<br><br>if i hadn't have found a bus stop along the way, and got the next bus into oxford town... i would have probably got completely drenched again and cryed all the way back to the station... but i tried to calm down and just focus on getting to the staion in time... as it was, i got there very early, and so i sat and had a strong black coffee to calm me down... i fished out my very damp mobile, and wrote kim a message... thanking her for letting me stay, and apologising for everything... and trying to explain why i felt that way... then i sent it... kim and dan were going down for breakfast when i left them... and i guess that she went to her parents when she got back, to collect her son... and has since gone back home to face another night in the house with her ex wandering about the place...<br><br>i haven't heard anything from her since, but i asked her to get in touch as soon as she could... of course, this won't be easy if she's had to go back home to find him still about... but i hope she'll want to speak to me soon... i'd hate to think that i've upset her so much that she never wants to speak to me again... but i'm not thinking staright now... and i'm incredibly paranoid... i feel so insecure, lonely and unwanted all of a sudden... i really regret going to oxford now... despite the gig being really good... i think i'd have chosen not to bother, if i'd have known how difficult this was going to be... it hurt so much to be so close to kim, and yet feel so far away... and now i feel like i've just become another 'problem' for her to deal with... that i'm 'too much' or something bad... everything's been so delicately balanced recently... ever since london... she's said a few things, many contradictory, that make me feel as if this love is doomed to fail once more... and i really don't think i could bare to lose her now... it's just too much to even contemplate...<br><br>i hope i'm wrong... but i just don't know anymore... it tears me up inside to think about this possibility of this going wrong... if it hasn't already... i just feel really messed-up right now... i really need a damn good cry i think.<br><br>sorry this message is so awful... i'm not goignt o read it back, because i'll probably feel even worse - having to remember it all again... i guess i shouldn't send it to you really... but i can't pretend that everything went well... because right now, i feel like everything went completely wrong... i know it wasn't all bad... but the worst bits kind of overshadow any simple moments of fun or happiness that there were...<br><br>all i want right now is to talk to kim, but i can't do that... so i'm trapped with my self-doubt and paranoia... and i don't think i'll feel any better about this until i do hear something from her... something that will hopefully not confirm my worst fears...<br><br>sorry again for this crappy message... i'm sure you have better things to do than read this nonsense... i just needed to tell someone what really happened... and you're the only person i know you i can explain all this to right now... please don't tell anyone else about this... kim would parobably never speak to me again if she knew i'd sent this to you.<br><br>byebye lisa...<br><br>lots of love...<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

i'm far too sensitive for my own good...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i'm writing you this message, in the vain hope that you might check your inbox... or even be able to check it... because i'm sure that right now there is no other safe way of contacting you...<br><br>are you okay, my angel? is everything alright there?<br><br>i'm sorry for irritating you at oxford, it's the very last thing i wanted to do... but i just found it really difficult to pretend i was a vitual stranger, when i feel so close to you... and you looked so beautiful... i felt rather numb, not being able to be closer to you, or tell you what i was feeling... and you definately do not look awful in the morning, or even when we got drenched with rain... you still looked gorgeous... your yummy blue eyes are always sparkling and bright... they make me feel something indescribable, deep inside... you make me feel alive...<br><br>i hope you aren't really angry with me... i tried to just fit in, but failed unfortunately... i've become really nervous and insecure since leaving, and i'm scared that you won't want to speak to me - even if you can... i feel like i really let you down, and i wish i hadn't... i actually wish that i hadn't gone there now... i felt that i was in the way... just another 'problem'  that you had to cope with...<br><br>i didn't arrive there in the best of moods... i went in a pub before going into the park and had a few drinks... but when i went to the toilet - and freshened up - i had a massive nose bleed, that took me almost an hour to stop... i was rather fed up after that, and didn't feel atall well... karen stayed with me for a while in the park... but because she was in the enclosure at the front of the stage, she had to leave to go back and keep her place... so i spent a couple of hours or more there, completely alone...<br><br>when you told me what had happened that morning at home, i felt my heart sink... i knew it was the last thing you needed right then... yet another confrontation/ultimatum... and when you said that you might have to stay at home - rather than go and stay elsewhere until the sale had gone through - i realised that things were going to get really awkward for you again... all the space you'd had in the previous week - and your calm and happy state of mind, that i witnessed in london - would be tested yet again... and i knew that it would make the possibilty of hearing from you, or even coming to see you again, incredibly difficult... so i felt really down... and i wanted to comfort you or say something to help you feel better... but i realised that i couldn't say a thing... i didn't know what i could or couldn't say in front of dan... so i ended up going really quiet, and just agreeing with what was already being said... i felt a bit lost...<br><br>i should have been able to cope with this better, but a combination of things made it seem really hopeless... i was seeing everything in a bad light... i felt incredibly insecure and paranoid... i thought you probably wanted me to just piss off and leave you both... but you seemed to want me to follow you around still... i don't know if this was because you did want me there, or were just concerned about me... i probably took everything the wrong way... the more you asked me if i was okay, or what was wrong... the more quiet and awkward i felt... it was abit like those really awkward moments in london, but without a way to resolve what was rolling about inside my head... i stopped looking at you eventually, because i knew i'd just breakdown if you asked me what was wrong again... during radiohead, later on, i was ready to walk off when you said i was really annoying... i was making you angry, and i could hardly speak anymore... i was convinced that i'd fucked everything up, and that you'd never want to hear from me again...<br><br>i was getting really upset by that point... i couldn't believe it when you offered me the chance to stay in your room... i was sure that you just wanted me to leave you both alone... although, i guess you were concerned about what happened to me... i felt it was quite appropriate to hear "i'm not here, this isn't happening", as the rain began to soak us to the skin... and why they chose to play 'creep' last, i'm not sure... but that's exactly how i felt right at that moment... like i just didn't belong there atall... i'm incredibly sensitive, just like you - as you've said before - and so i guess anything awkward was going to be difficult for me to deal with... but i did an even worse job of it than even i thought i would...<br><br>you seemed very self-conscious when we were in the room together... i tried not to stare at you... but you know how i think you are always beautiful, gorgeous and completely adorable, however you look... i'm glad that we still managed to exchange a few warm smiles and glances, that helped me feel a lot better about the situation... i didn't sleep much, although i did get some... everything was still rolling about my head, and i didn't know what to do or say to make things better... when you were getting ready in the morning, you seemed really irritated that i was still there... when i was leaving - and you were getting ready for breakfast - i wanted to say something, to tell you that you looked fine... or ask you to call me, or something... i don't know what was running through my mind at that point... but you really got annoyed with me, and just told me to stop hanging about and go... so i left... i walked back out into the rain... feeling really torn-up inside... as if i'd just lost everything that's precious and special to me...<br><br>kim, i love you... and i'm not sure what you feel about me... i could just be overeacting really badly to what happened... anyway, you probably have much more important things to worry about right now... but please will you try to just call for a few seconds or send a message or something... i want to know if you hate me or not... every moment we have spent 'together' in the past few months, has made me feel more happy and loved than i've been for a very long time... you make me feel so special... and meeting you in london was just pure bliss... i hope that you still feel these strong emotions towards me, and that i haven't just messed everything up... i don't know what i've done, but right now i feel like i'm to blame for all this going wrong... i'm sure i am... and i know that i can't just pick up the phone and call you... so i'm stuck here, wondering if you'll ever speak to me - or see me - ever again...<br><br>i miss you so much, my angel... i hope i hear from you soon...<br><br>*big warm hugs and kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

hello...
<br><br>hello lisa,<br><br><br>no, i'm not alright atall...<br><br>i'm miserable... i still haven't heard from kim since leaving oxford... i don't know if she's at home, or has moved to somewhere to stay... i don't know if she's avoiding contact with me because she doesn't want to talk to me, or because she's being 'observed', or because she's busy trying to arrange something... she could even have gone back to work, but she was meant to be off for a week until wednesday, because she was too unstable to work in class... i just don't know what to do... i can't call her, incase he's there... if i call her mobile or send her a text message, i don't know where she is... so i don't know if it's safe to do that or not... i've looked for her online, and haven't gone out atall since i came back... just incase she called me... the only way i can contact her at the moment is through this inbox... i sent her a message when i did yours... but i'm not sure if she'll check to see if i've sent her anything, or even if she's able to check... maybe she doesn't even want to hear from me...  :-(<br><br>i'm feeling really upset and over-emotional... i don't really understand why she hasn't just called for a minute, or sent a message... i haven't heard anything from her...<br><br>i'm half-convinced now that i'll never hear from her again... and that completely terrifies me... i don't know how i'd cope without her... it's only been just over two days, but i've never had this total silence before... even when she stayed at her parents once, she still called me... i keep thinking i should take a chance and just call, or send her a really simple message... but i don't want to fuck things up for her, if 'someone else' is still about... i don't want to annoy her even more than i think i have... <br><br>i can't stop crying, whenever i'm alone... i'm trying to stay busy by doing some of my work, but i just can't concentrate... i'm getting really desperate to hear from her... even if it's only for a matter of seconds...<br><br>i love her so much... my heart's in shreds right now... i just don't know what to do... i feel so numb.<br><br>sorry... i still haven't sent your parcel, i just haven't been able to think straight since sunday...<br><br>thanks for staying in touch lisa, it means a lot to me...<br><br><br>lotsoflove. x x x<br><br><br>bye...<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

I am a bit worried about you.  Either you have no interest in talking with me anymore, or you are very, very upset.  Is there something I can do to help?  Anything?  Have you heard from her yet?<br><br>Hey... radiohead is on the cover of Rollingstone here, do you want a copy or can you get one there?  Southpark is on tomorrow night and I am planning on taping it for you if you are still interested.<br><br>Well... maybe you just want to be alone.  I hope that you are alright.<br><br>lisa<br>

<br><br>hello lisa,<br><br><br>sorry to be talking about me and kim all the time, but it gets even stranger now...<br><br>after kim called on my mobile at lunchtime, i got a call on my standard line - after lunch - from a really cocky guy... with a very strong east london accent...<br><br><br>11 July 2001<br>14:00 hrs<br><br>- hi?<br><br>- who's that???<br><br>- what do you mean 'who's that'???<br><br>- i think i've got the wrong number...<br><br>- yeah, i think you have!<br><br>- is that steve?<br><br>- no, you've got the wrong number... bye...<br><br><br>i didn't think much of it... but it sounded unusual, so i checked the number to see where he was calling from... and found out that he'd witheld his number... now it sounded suspicious to me... why would someone calling from a normal residential phone deliberately not leave their number?<br><br>later on, i get a text message on my mobile from kim:<br><br><br>Paul found bill. Knows we met. He may call you. Please don't say anything !<br><br>Sender: kim<br>Sent: 11 July 2001<br>18:54:58<br><br><br>so, now i'm convinced it was 'him' calling me earlier...<br><br>i can't call kim... to tell her... or ask what's going on, etc...  i've to leave my answerphone on now, without any outgoing message... i don't want to answer any more calls, incase it's cocky bastard again... my phone was ringing for ages sometime after i got kim's message... and again, when i checked the number - there was nothing there... then it rings again, and again, and again... then my mobile rings... so now i don't even know if he's got her mobile or not... so if i answer it - from now on - i can't say anything until i hear her speak...<br><br>uuuggggghhh!!!<br><br>i think i'm going insane again... *drinks lots of water*  :-S<br><br>please tell me i'm not going mad? i feel like laughing and crying at the same time... keep in touch, doctor bu... i may need help soon... and lots of it!!!<br><br>bye...<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br><br>:-S<br><br>

something beginning with 'p'...
<br><br>hello lisa,<br><br><br>kim spoke to me during her lunch break... i sent you an email about it, didn't i?<br><br>she couldn't talk for long... just said that she was fine, and that she wasn't pissed off with me... it was just an awkward situation at oxford - hence the tension... but it was just frustration i think... oh, and she also told me to stop being so paranoid about things, too...  ;-)<br><br>kim is back home... and so is 'it', unfortunately... she said that she had to keep off the internet, because she's letting her son use the computer to finish a large english project... and she doesn't want to have to sneak around in the house trying to contact me, not whilst 'it' is there... that's why things have been really quiet... kim only went back to work today... it was the first chance she's had away from home to call... so everything was kinda okay... she said that things at home were 'okay'... in other words, there was no major tension about the place...<br><br>but, this was all before 'it' called me... then i find out from kim's text message that 'it' has found a phone bill with my number(s) on it... 'knows we met'... not sure exactly what kim means by 'knows'... but i'll have to try to contact her tomorrow sometime - whilst she's at school -  and find out more... i'm assuming that she still has her mobile, of course!<br><br>btw... i refuse to call 'it' by their real name, or refer to them as in any way human from now on... only by 'it', or 'pig'... actually 'pig' seems rather more appropriate, really...<br><br>kim told 'pig' that she'd move out with her son, if 'it' came back and started pissing about again... so i don't know how she's going to react or cope with this current situtation... 'pig' has obviously confronted her with a phone bill and something else... she said that 'it' has been convinced that she's being having an affair with someone, since late last year... despite the fact that she hasn't... and that no matter what she tells 'it' about what a pig he's been, and how 'it' has treated her and her son, 'pig' keeps returning obsessively to this idea that she's leaving 'it' for another reason... 'it' is either completely thick, or has a few slates missing... there's definately something wrong with the 'pig'... if 'it' can't accept the truth...<br><br>of course, this current 'situation' might well mean that 'it' will cause even more trouble over buying-out the house, and letting her move on... she still needs the money from the sale to find her own place... and she can't legally lock the 'pig' out of the house that 'it' part-owns with her... so she's stuck in this seemingly-eternal loop... waiting for 'it' to give up all this hassling and pissing about... then kim and her son, might be able to live in a more peaceful environment... which is what they need right now... a bit of space... room to breathe...<br><br>so, i still feel rather hopeless... kim seems to be back where she was before... with the 'pig' causing her more aggrivation and stress... and she's still unable to move on, and get 'it' out of her life for good... or maybe this will just move things along quicker... i don't know... according to her, 'it' is a spiteful bastard... and wouldn't need much of an excuse to rip her off... by either... delaying a sale, or getting solicitors involved - to try to put her in a legal and financial 'trap'...<br><br>i hope she's okay tonight... i hate not knowing what's going on... i get worried for her... i love her so much... and i miss her terribly...<br><br>i think i need more water... *checks temperature...*  :-S<br><br>stay in touch, sweet angel... it means a lot to me, that you care so much...<br><br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

<br><br>hi lisa,<br><br><br>thanks for thinking about me, it really means a lot...<br><br>i'm okay-ish today... i guess i'm just hiding things better... but my heart still aches... actually, it really hurts...<br><br>i wish i could still chat with you, just for a while, but i guess i can't... and i don't want to publish any of this on the 'bored' either... so i'll just have to write these emails and messages instead...<br><br>i'm not sure anyone can do anything to help me actually... except for kim... and i guess she has enough to deal with right now... she obviously wants us to remain friends... she said she loves me, but only as a friend... i don't really know quite what's happened yet, but something definitely changed when 'he' came home last saturday morning... kim seemed very different at oxford, which unnerved me a lot... and led to me feeling more down about things... it was the complete opposite the week before... she was relieved about the fact that he'd decided to buy the house, and things were been put into action at last... the very last thing she was considering is what she appears to have done... ie: go back to living with him again... 'give it another go' etc...<br><br>she's going to call me again on monday... so i might know a little more then... if not... i'll try to persuade her to get in touch with me a little more next week... this is really difficult to understand... it seems like she's just given up... she seems to have got really frightened by the prospect of actually continuing everything... moving out... leaving him for good... finding a new place for her son and her to live in... wanting me to be with her... it seems as if she's just reached the limit to what she can cope with... she said she was ill again, and wasn't teaching much... she spoke to me yesterday in the staff room... and she sounded really tired... i guess she's just got afraid of what it might do to her, mentally, if she'd pushed things much further... seeing as how every step she took seemed to affect her even more...<br><br>it's the only explaination i can think of... that she's just had enough of all the stress that this has involved...<br><br>i still don't really understand how everything switched so suddenly... virtually overnight...<br><br>one week she loved me, and wanted me to be with her... she said she was in love with me, many times, when we spoke before... and that she meant it... she treated me like someone really precious and special in london, she didn't recoil from anything i said to her or did... even the week before oxford... she never gave me the impression that this was as far as it all went... full stop... we still spoke every single day and night to each other... now it all means nothing... it seems as if everything that was said before, simply doesn't matter any longer... all her passion and desire, her love and affection for me... it's all vanished...<br><br>'just friends'...<br><br>maybe i'm stupid... but i just don't get it...<br><br>everything i've said to her, i meant... my feelings have never changed, they only got stronger... when i met her in london, i could hardly believe just how wonderful she was in real life... she seemed so much more than i'd imagined her to be... really special... completely unique... and now i feel as if i've lost her... and losing so much, after so little time together... it just kills me... i truely never believed for a second that this would happen... after all the hope, and all the happiness there was between us... to have it all cut dead so suddenly... it's just too much...<br><br>i don't know how i'll ever get over this... i don't think kim really understands just how much i care for her... just how deep all of this goes... i did tell her... i made it very clear what i felt... and i'm sure she knows what this would do to me... she's well aware of what's happened to me on countless occasions before... which is why i don't understand why she's just suddenly changed her mind about everything... it's just extremely unusual... especially, considering what she's said about how these 'give it another go' situations have gone before... she said that she'd never, ever have him back in her life... i just don't understand why she's completely contradicted everything she once said...<br><br>it seems as if all my deepest insecurities and paranoia about myself, have proved true after all... yet again... even when people say they are in love with me, they still don't want to be with me... after all...<br><br>i think i'm just destined to be alone... forever... i don't think i'll ever trust anything anyone says to me ever again... i got so close to her heart... and she still consumes all my feelings and thoughts, even now... how can i ever recover... i'll never find anyone quite like kim again... she's completely unique... we were so well-matched, it seemed completely unreal just how much we have in common... i've never met anyone like her before... and now... it's all gone... this is going to haunt me forever... i just know it is... it just tears me apart to think about it...<br><br>i'm trying to bury my emotions today... i need to find some way to carry on... to just do something, without collapsing in tears every five minutes - as i did yesterday... but i'm still completely numb... i can't cope with all these mixed emotions... i'm still in love with kim... and i still don't know what to do... every time i close my eyes, i see her face... it's really heartbreaking...<br><br>we will have to stay really close, for me to get over this... maybe i can still be her friend... i don't know right now... all i do know is that i'm going to have to speak with her much more than i'm able to do right now... two short phone calls in one week is not enough to help me through this... i'm going to have to spend a lot more time discussing all this with her, before i can resolve some of these feelings i have... because right now... it still hurts like hell, whenever i think of her... and i can't stop thinking about her... it's just agony...<br><br>sorry you got to read this again lisa... i'll try to write something more interesting soon... but i really am completely lost right now...  :-(<br><br>i really wish i could have a proper hug... but thanks for the *hug*... because i know that you really mean it...<br><br>write to me again, please... tell me how you are doing... i hope you are alright...<br><br>you really are an angel lisa... thanks for staying in touch... *big hugs*<br><br>byebye for now...<br><br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br>

i have completely given up on my standard email and decided to try this.  i have been very worried about you!!!  i have been thinking of you constantly and wondering what was going on.<br><br>thank you for the email.  i am so sorry that all of this happened... i know you were counting on this relationship to happen and that you love her very much.<br><br>can i give you a bit of advice?  kim needs some space.  i know you said you need to speak with her more than twice a week... quick phone calls... to get over this.  but you have to understand the position she is in.  there is so much going on now in her life, what she needs is support and space, not someone demanding her time... someone else to take care of.  you are a very demanding person... and i dont mean this in a bad way.  but from personal experience and what i have heard you tell me about your experiences with kim, you require a lot of attention and support.  more than she probably has to give right now.  let her have some space.  if you pressure her to talk more with you.. you will only push her further away.  what she needs is someone to lean on... someone who is giving to her, not taking.<br><br>i am so sorry you are feeling useless and unloved.  i dont know what to say.  you are a wonderful person gordon, and i have told you this time and time again.  what you need to do is to tell yourself this, not just depend on hearing it from others.  <br><br>i wont sit here and psychoanalyze... i know you dont need that now.  but if you would like to talk about this further... please let me know.  <br><br><br>again... i am so sorry.<br><br>lisa

<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>thanks for your reply.<br><br>please don't worry about me... i don't want to become a problem for you again too... sorry, i just didn't know who else to write to, or speak to about this.<br><br>i guess i did count on this relationship, yes, that's true... but only because it all seemed possible, and it seemed like something that we both really wanted... it took me a long time to understand my feelings for kim... a lot longer than i think it did for her... i would never have got so close to her, if i'd thought for one moment that this would happen... i certainly never dreamt that we'd fall in love... i just thought i'd found a friend... kim was the one who pushed everything here... demanding to spend time with me... she used to call me on the phone every single night... talk to me for hours at a time... we shared so much, in such a short space of time... we've only known each other for three months, and yet it feels like i've known her for over twice as long as that...<br><br>yes, i know kim needs space... you should understand that i can't make any demands of kim, even if i wanted to... which i don't... i can only speak or chat to kim when she contacts me... i promised that i'd never call her there, without her expecting me to... and i would never break that promise... so, i can't really impose myself atall... this whole thing is totally dependent on her choosing to talk to me or not... the worst thing about last week was that i realised just how reliant i am on her contacting me, because it's impossible for me to get in touch with her when she's not in work... and not knowing if she was okay last week, was very difficult to deal with... i was worried sick... because it was very unlike her to not let me know she was alright... but, really... i can't literally demand her time atall... i can only wait... and wait... and wait...<br><br>i've always been here for kim... i've spent countless hours reassuring her about things... hearing her troubles and trying to help her through things... she said that she wouldn't have coped without me... that she wouldn't have ever had the confidence to make the changes she's tried to put in place in her life... but i think she began to see my love as simply extra pressure, which she couldn't or didn't want to have to cope with right now... she used the word 'heavy' a few times after we'd met in london, when discussing everything... which made me a little unsure about things... but, she gave me everything i did and more... right from the very start... she was incredibly possessive of me... extremely passionate... and very demanding... she couldn't stand the idea that i gave my attention to anyone else... it took a long time to calm her down in this respect... we are incredibly alike in terms of our emotional responses... very self-conscious, self-critical, paranoid and requiring a lot of reassurance... we spent many hours telling each other, over and over, that we really meant the things we were saying to each other...<br><br>i think the first time i asked her to do anything for me was last week... i sent her a few messages asking if she'd call, when she had the chance... because i was concerned about her, having not heard a thing from her since oxford... kim was the one who wanted me to go to london to meet her... wanted me to move to london earlier than i'd planned, because she wanted me to be with her... but i never saw this as a set of demands... i knew, or thought i did, that she wanted love and someone to really care about her... she said she did... kim told me that she'd never been treated so nicely for as long as she could remember... that she was just so used to being treated badly... that i'd made her realise that there's better things out there for her... that she deserves so much more... that she deserves to be loved and cared for... kim's just as needing of attention and support, if not much more, as me... infact, definately more than me... and i've always given her as much as i could give... and i still will, whenever she needs someone to rely on... she knows i'm here for her...<br><br>i know you've told me countless times that you think i'm a wonderful person... kim has always told me this too... many people have... but... it never prevents me from feeling useless... everytime something like this happens to me, it completely dismantles any fragile shred of self-confidence that i had before... the past two or three months i've know kim, i've felt happier and more confident about myself than i have for a long time... the things she said to me, did much more than simply warm my heart... i really did reach the stars this time... but now i've been sent crashing back to earth and i'm all bruised and battered... and when i look in the mirror, all i can see are the 'scars'... all the defects about me that i couldn't ignore before... things that never really mattered to me a month ago, are suddenly in my mind again... a lot of hopeless thoughts, once more...<br><br>i do wish i could chat with you somehow... but i really don't want to burden you with my problems any more than i already have... i feel ever so guilty for you worrying about me... anyway, i can't chat on a public board or anything like that... this is all extremely private, and you are the only other person i've shared any of this with... i just needed to say some of this to someone... someone who cares about me... because i'd just drive myself mad thinking about it otherwise... maybe it's easier to write these messages anyhow... even if i could chat with you online, i might just spend a lot of the time silent... i can hardly think straight at the moment...<br><br>thanks for tolerating my nonsense... you are an angel lisa... *hugs*<br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br>

<br><br>hi lisa,<br><br><br>thanks again for your kind words... i know that you care about me, and what happens to me... i wish you could help me too, but i really can't imagine that anyone can... it's just going  to take me a very long time to recover from this... hopefully kim will want to stay in touch and remain close to me... i really can't see how i'll get over this if i hardly ever hear from her... i am really frightened of losing her completely... and i'm worried about what's going to happen for her now... she really deserves better than what she's putting up with now... it's just so unfair that someone as wonderful as her has to cope with such crap... this upsets me even more than if she'd said we couldn't be together, but had found a bit of space in her life... and was in a much calmer atmosphere right now...<br><br>anyway... i think i'm going to try and get some sleep now... i haven't had very much of that, this last week... hopefully i'll be tired enough to fall asleep straight away... that way i won't still be thinking about everything again, and upsetting myself even more...<br><br>i'll write again tomorrow... and i'll try not to be so boring too... i'm sure you must have better things to do than read my tear-stained mutterings...<br><br>thanks for staying in touch, sweet angel... this means such a lot to me... *hugs*<br><br>lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br><br>:-x<br><br>

let down...
oh gordon... i am so sorry.  i wish there was something i could do to make you feel better.  after flying so high on emotion, to have that come to such an abrupt end...  :(    please let me know if there is anything i can do to make you feel better.<br><br>i have been working like mad... its been insane!  i am not sure how long i can do this... i need to for at least a while to pay off some bills.  my part-time job at home has turned in a full-time job that requires a lot of overtime some days!  :/  i am hoping it will even itself out soon.  tuesdays are ALWAYS bad days... today is not so bad.  i went to the acupuncturist this morning.  ever been to one?  she is wonderful... a really fun person.  she put LOTS o' needles in me today!  said my heart is not doing well at the moment...  all the needles she put in those meridians hurt!  so i came home and took a nap and am going to work on caring for my heart.  now i wonder what she would say about your heart?<br><br>our weather here today is beautiful... we have had clouds and showers on and off for the past week, but it is going to heat up again.  it is in the 80's (fahrenhite of course!!), but the sun is shining and there is a cool breeze.  it should get back up into the 90's by sunday.  :/   how is your weather these days?  i bet your air smells wonderful!  nice cool ocean breezes...  *sigh*<br><br>i heard from a girl i met at the Gorge concert that is a messageboard person.  she just got back from oxford actually!  she is following the band around this tour it seems.  she said she has some interesting stories to tell about the oxford concert... she is going to write soon.  i am excited to hear.  i have heard NOTHING good from the oxford show!  everyone it seems had a lousy time for some reason or another!<br><br>well.... i should probably go and get some typing done (work that is!  ;)    i just finished my lunch... blue corn tortilla chips with refried beans and salsa.... YUM!!   i just can't seem to get terribly motivated.  it feels like a good day to sit and watch a movie or something.  oh hey... i saw Billy Elliott the other day, have you seen it?  it is a wonderful movie!  i really enjoyed it.  that and Memento... also a really good movie.  can you tell i am procrastinating???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????<br><br>doh.  ok.  now i will go.  <br><br>oh... did you see the new rh Southpark shirt?  the one with the guys drawn as Southpark characters?  its up in the waste shop now.  it is great!!  i am thinking of getting one.  did you watch the show yet?  i know it is up online somewhere.  i will send you a copy of it though... it will be much better to see on screen.  <br><br>ok.  now i SWEAR........ no more procrastinating!!!!!!!<br><br>i hope that you are doing better.  take it easy on yourself and get some rest!  maybe take a nice walk outside in the sunshine.<br><br>i will write again soon... keep in touch and let me know that you are ok.<br><br>lisa

breathe, keep breathing...
<br><br>hi lisa,<br><br><br>i wish i could feel better too... but i know that the only way i will begin to feel any better is when kim starts to contact me again... until i can talk with her - and know that she wants to stay 'close' to me - i don't know what i'm going to do... i know for sure that i can't feel happy without her friendship... i just don't want to lose her... i won't be able to cope with that... and if i don't hear from her soon, i'm going to feel much worse... this isn't getting any easier... the silence is deafening.  :-(<br><br>i flew too high, too early. i burnt my wings in the fire, and fell back to earth with a crash. now i'm covered in bruises and scars. i wear only fake smiles. my tears of joy have turned sour, they just sting my eyes and stain my skin. my heart, once filled with intense desire, now feels all empty and sore. i yearn for her beautiful smiles, hypnotic glances, and precious kisses. but all i have are the memories of half-forgotten moments we once shared.<br><br>i don't think i realised just how much i love kim, until we met... i didn't understand how deep my feelings were for her... now i know for sure, because i'm having to deal with her rejection of my love... and yet i still feel everything i did before... except, now it hurts me... rather than filling me with joy and happiness, it just tears me up inside.  :-(<br><br>sorry for all this nonsense again... i'm afraid that my mind is rather pre-occupied at the moment, with all these unanswered questions and memories of the time i spent with kim... i feel incredibly stupid about this... i think i sound really dumb.<br><br>you appear to be terribly busy... i hope that you still have some time away from your work... i know when i worked long hours - from morning to night - it really did me in, mentally and physically... i felt as if i'd become a machine, to some degree... and i started feeling ill, whenever i thought about work... so i had to stop the routine... me and 'routines' just don't work well together...  :-S<br><br>i hope your are okay... what does she mean by 'your heart is not doing well'?<br><br>i've never been to an acupuncturist... although i guess i could do with a little alternative therapy of some kind... what would she say about my heart? ...oh, erm... probably 'completely fucked' or something like that... it's shattered and hanging by a thread at the moment... i feel really sick... i know that much.  :-S<br><br>our weather is what our forecasters call 'changeable'... it's been raining a lot, so it's rather cold... it was very sunny and windy yesterday... today it's doing nothing in particular... occasionally sunny, but mostly overcast and grey... 'cool ocean breezes... wonderful smells...'? ...the only smelly thing around here is the irish sea... and that isn't 'wonderful' too often... but i guess it's nice sometimes... i really don't appreciate these things at the moment though... i think my senses are all buggered.  :-(<br><br>erm... oxford was really good... the gig was definately very special... and i'll never forget it - even though i'd rather forget about certain things... if i'd arrived there in a better frame of mind, and there wasn't so much tension between myself and kim, i would definately have enjoyed myself a lot more... getting absolutely soaked during 'how to disappear completely' is one of those moments i will always remember... if i hadn't been so close to tears, i would have found it such an exhilarating and joyful moment... it would still have caught my emotions... and 'creep', at the end, was really incredible... totally unexpected...  :-O<br><br>i think that the stuff they played about halfway through the set was best... they did a really powerful 'my iron lung', which is kim's favourite live track - and got her very excited... 'i might be wrong', 'paranoid android' and 'idioteque' were my favourites... they were the ones that i couldn't stop myself moving about to... but it was all good... the band were definately more 'alive' than i've seen them before... possibly over-compensating for their nerves somewhat... and i was completely numb, because i was over-compensating for my mixed-up emotions...<br><br>i guess that it was all the other 'stuff' - which had nothing much to do with the gig - that altered my perspective on things... i had far too much on my mind, to just relax and lose myself completely in the moment... but 'exit music' did make me cry... and i was also in tears throughout 'how to disappear completely' - trying in vain to mouth the words 'i'm not here, this isn't happening', whilst the rain drenched me to the bone... i was signing along to 'creep' at the end, and i suddenly realised that i actually felt everything in that song... at that moment, it was far too appropriate... it was just too much for me...  :-(<br><br>anyhow... your lunch sounded rather interesting and yummy... i had an apple this morning... that's as exciting as it's got here!!! maybe i should actually eat something... i do feel terribly weak.<br><br>i haven't watched a film for ages... i don't think i have the attention span - at the moment - to do something like that... i know about the ones you mentioned though... i think i'd probably watch 'memento' if i had the chance... that one sounds really good... a really interesting idea... i usually like things that get me thinking.<br><br>yeah, i saw those shirts you are talking about at the gig... we were sitting outside the w.a.s.t.e. tent for most of the time before radiohead came on, but it was very busy in there, and so i didn't bother going to take a proper look... i doubt that i would have bought one anyhow... but i do like the designs... very good... never ones to let irony pass them by, are they?  ;-)<br><br>btw. if you like that... you might like this too... http://www.aahlookout.com/apie.html<br><br>oh! what? ...'procrastinating'? ...you? ...never!  ;-)<br><br>i am trying to take things easy, but it's really difficult to cope with this deadly silence... i know i'd feel so much happier about things if i i could just spend a little time with kim... we've shared too much... to let it all end so suddenly, just seems so unfair... i really want to remain her 'best friend', and she said she wanted that too - more than anything... we really do have so much in common... i've never known anyone quite like her before... i just wish that she'd call me, or send me a message so i know everything's alright... i don't want much... just something to reassure me a little, because i know that i can't do that myself... there's only one person who can make me feel really happy right now... so i just keep waiting...<br><br>oh, and i do still take walks in the sunshine...  ;-)<br><br>thanks for being so bloody nice to me lisa... you are an angel... you always make me smile and feel better about life... it's good to know that someone cares so much... *big warm hug*<br><br>please write to me again, when you can... and don't work too hard, or your fingers will fall off...  :-S<br><br>byebye for now... lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br>

silent... silent...
<br><br>hi lisa,<br><br><br>glad to hear that you are making good use of all your 'idle time'... hehe... sorry!  ;-)<br><br>it was very sunny here this morning... i was going to go out and take some pictures, but the cloud isn't how i want it really... and it's gone rather bland outside now... but i think i will go out anyway, and have a wander about in town... just to give me something to do...<br><br>i am okay, really... it's just that my emotional side that's taken over... it actually took over a while ago, but it was a good feeling... i was all happy and motivated... since everything 'collapsed', my emotions haven't really changed... the intensity i felt before is still there, it's just that the feelings are all negative now... everything used to be outward and giving, but now i have no one to give my love to - it's all turned inward - so it hurts like hell... and makes me feel sick all the time...  :-S<br><br>yes, i will try to eat something... and keep drinking the water... i've not been too good at the 'food' bit recently... i've lost my will to eat anything... whenever i try to, i often end up leaving most of it... something i never did before...<br><br>what will happen if i don't hear from kim anymore??? ...oh fuck, i don't know... i really don't know... 'holding my breath' is a very good way of describing how i feel right now... i am choking on the silence... what will happen? ...i really haven't got a clue... i think that would completely destroy me... i'm really depressed at the moment... if i didn't hear a thing, i don't know what would happen... i really don't... that's the one thing that truely frightens me... this is developing into the worst possible scenario... just silence... a deadly silence...  :-(<br><br>i just wish that kim would speak to me... i'm sure she knows what this must be doing to me... she asked me shortly before oxford about this... i said that if we never became anything closer than 'best friends', the only way i would cope with everything would be if we were still 'close'... that we'd have to stay in touch, or i'd never be able to deal with my feelings... i'm quite sure now that kim had already decided that we would never be together... i just never knew for sure... but i still don't understand why... after everything that was said and felt... why??? ...i really need to understand this, otherwise i'll never get beyond all this hopelessness...<br><br>uuuggghhh...<br><br>glad you liked that cartoon... yeah, some people do have far too much time on their hands... i do, right now... the trouble is... i just can't do anything... i'm fucked.  :-(<br><br>your parcel? ...i ran out of excuses months ago! ...i will try to get something sent off tomorrow. i want to send nari's too, because i'm sure she's just as pissed off with my uselessness... the problem i've had recently (this is not an excuse!) is that i've had to destroy each of the letters i wrote... i got rid of the first ones i wrote for you - it didn't seem right to send them anymore... i didn't want to embarass you... and the ones i've written since make no sense now... because, well... you know... you've heard nothing else for this past week or two... how do i write a letter, without it sounding utterly depressing?<br><br>narissa doesn't even know about this... the last time we spoke, i'd just got back from london... she was on the 'bored', asking myself and kim about how it went... she was really happy for us both... everything was great... i just don't know what to write now... i've destroyed two of my letters to her already... i guess i should just write something simple... nothing much... but i don't find it easy at the moment... i really wanted for you both to have something good to read... i wanted you both to know how happy i was... now it's all void...  :-(<br><br>if i'd only heard from kim, i could probably see things more rationally, but i'm all over the place at the moment... i keep bursting into tears, without warning... i'm a mess...<br><br>when i type things out on here for you, i erase entire paragraphs of rubbish... i constantly retype lines... maybe i should get drunk tonight, find some paper and write down what's in my head... hmmm... maybe that's not such a good idea...<br><br>well, i'll try to do something before tomorrow comes... i just need some energy... and something to write... ummm... these are going to be really strange letters...  :-S<br><br>'amazing grace' and 'jesus gonna be here'? ...okay, i will try to listen to that sometime... but i'm honestly not in the mood for gospel right now... i keep playing a lot of old 'new wave' stuff... just to get me jumping about the place... anything with a really mad rhythm and crazy sound... something i can lose myself in... yesterday it was mostly 'the psychedelic furs', 'captain beefheart' and 'joy division'... i also put on 'ok computer', for the first time in ages, and tried to sing along to 'exit music' - completely in tears...<br><br>i know about 'cold feet', yeah... i don't think i've ever watched it... although years ago, i used to fancy the pants off helen baxendale - great actress or not... but i don't really bother watching television... i only put it on for the news these days... and 'brass eye', which makes me smile...<br><br>i don't mind you rambling atall, btw... i do enough of that too... this message is getting really long isn't it? time to erase something i think...  :-S<br><br>hey, you can keep your dumb president... we don't want him... we threw a cordon around the country and blocked all the airports... and he still got in!!! ...but seeing as he loves 'mr blur' so much, can he take him back to the u.s. with him??? ...because we don't want either of them!!! apparently 'mr blur' said, the other day, that all the protesters in genoa were all 'simply wrong'!!! ...fucking confident, smug bastard, isn't he? ...go on, take them both... please??? ...you can do whatever you want with them!!!<br><br>i was nosing about on the 'bored' yesterday... i didn't post much though... no one to chat to really... nothing to say... i didn't see you there... i guess i missed you... franki deleted 'fact', 'poll' and 'yay!', because someone was flooding the board for hours using those names... that was about the only interesting thing that happened... i've only bothered posting there in these past few months, because kim, you, or nari did too... i don't feel like being a little mouse anymore... not unless 'ms o' returns... i doubt i'll bother much anymore... i've wasted far too much time on there already... i can't believe that some of them spend all day on that thing... actually, it's really quite disturbing... eek!  :-S<br><br>okay, i'll go now too... and try to do something constructive... thanks for thinking of me, and reading all my rubbish... you really are an angel, lisa... i'm ever so glad that you still write to me... i don't know what i'd do without you... and don't worry... i've been 'funny' for as long as i can remember too... just be careful that those fingers don't fall off...  ;-)<br><br>thanks again... thanks for caring so much...<br><br>byebye for now... and lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br>

oh man......... i have SOOOOOOOO much work to do today.  what the hell are they thinking anyway?  its FRIDAY for godsakes!!!<br><br>did you go out and take your pictures yet?  i would LOVE it if you would send me a digital photo of your lovely sea.  and i dont care what you say... i'll bet it smells wonderful!  ;p<br><br>our weather is nice today... well, actually a bit hot, but breezy.  of course i have just sat here in front of my computer all day, but it LOOKS nice from my window.  :(<br><br>did you read about the protester in Genoa who was killed?  do you know what pisses me off?  all i keep hearing about is the protestors who are smashing things up... etc.  i am reading NOTHING in any sort of detail why there are so many protestors there in the first place!  and that MOST are peaceful!!!!!  IT IS REALLY PISSING ME OFF!  and Bush...... ohchrist.  nevermind.  that will really piss me off if i get  going about him.  the whole summit is a fucking joke.  nothing of any significance will get done.  oh, except we will hear endless stories of the "anarchists" smashing up the city.  *sigh*  somedays i think it is absolutely hopeless.<br><br>i am sorry to hear that you haven't heard from kim yet.  perhaps she needs more time to sort things out, i just dunno.  you sound like you are doing maybe a bit better?  did you check out the board today?  i was there for a bit... lurking while printing out my work.  looked like a good group today.<br><br>and you are sending my parcel tomorrow?  really?  seriously?  should i hold my breath?  should i get your parcel together?  goodlord... i am practically paralyzed by the thought of actually receiving it now.  ;)<br><br>i suuuuuuuuuuuuupose i should get myself back to the grindstone.  and how is your site coming along these days?  maybe you can actually get it DONE now that you seem to have all this time on your hands!<br><br>i am listening to Supergrass at the moment.  actually saw them earlier this year... only caught the last part of the show though.  not quite sure what to think of them.  OH HEY!!!!  i was a HUGE Psychedelic (sp?) Furs fan in high school!!  gawd..... it has been soooooo long since i have heard them!  they had this one song... god, i cant remember the name of it... that i would play endlessly.  they are brilliant.  and i love Pretty in Pink... richard has such a fantastic voice.  i should go and try to dig it out.  good stuff.<br><br>*big sigh*  alright.... i suppose i am off again to get something done.  actually maybe i'll take a bath.  well.. actually i shouldn't.  i should get the majority of this done before the weekend.  decisions........decisions.   maybe i will check out da bored and see what they are up to.  maybe i will see you there.<br><br>take care AND SEND ME MY PARCEL GORDON!!!!!!!!<br><br>:)<br><br>

street fighting man...
<br><br>hiya lisa,<br><br><br>awww... you poor thing... working like crazy... *big hug*<br><br>i didn't take any pictures, because it went really bland yesterday, and it's not much better today... i'm hoping that it will be all bright sunshine and beautiful skies on sunday, then i can take those pictures i want to use... i will take some extra, if it's nice, to send your way... the irish sea really isn't too interesting, although it does look good when the sun sets in the evening... okay it does smell wonderful then... erm... sometimes...  ;-)<br><br>i bet it's nice where you are... i'm just watching planes land from my window... flying inland to the local aerodrome... it's quite nice weather today, but nothing special...<br><br>yeah, i know a bit about what happened in genoa... unfortunately the majority of the media is obsessed with the rioting and 'anarchists'... i was far more concerned about what the police were doing - beating unconscious peaceful protesters with their hands above their heads... many innocent people caught in the crossfire as usual... it must be a bloody nightmare for the peple who went there to demonstrate - finding themselves caught between a bunch of extremists who won't listen to reason, and trigger/batton-happy police, injuring everyone who gets in their way... it seems that a minority of the 'black bloc' started the rioting - smashing-up and burning anything in their path... and a fair amount of the italian police appeared to behave like complete thugs - beating everyone in sight, regardless... a real recipe for disaster...  :-S<br><br>it's amazing that more people aren't dead actually... i read some of the 'znet' and 'dropthedebt' eyewitness reports from italy, i think that many of the demonstraters are really fed up with the whole situation... and after everything is over, the mainstream media will still be going on about the 'anarchist rioters', which just gives the G8 another reason to withdraw from public view, and pushes the negotiations back behind closed doors. once again, all the important issues are able to be overlooked and dismissed, because there are plenty of dramatic pictures of police vans on fire in the streets... it's really sickening... all the counter-moves and distortions... such a bloody waste... it really does seem hopeless this time...  :-(<br><br>no, i still haven't heard from kim... i'm hoping too that she just needs time to sort things out, and will still get in touch with me again soon... i'm also guessing that she hasn't really had a moment by herself to call... i hope that's what it is anyway... i'd hate to discover that she was avoiding me intentionally for any reason... although, despite what you say, i am still not feeling any better... i'm just hiding things more... i really can't function properly... i keep breaking down in tears, and i still feel terribly depressed... this silence is really difficult to cope with... and it's just not like her to cut me off like this... it really does frighten me... i don't know what i can do, other than just wait... i'm still holding my breath...  :-S<br><br>i did spend a little time on the 'bored' yesterday, i don't know why though... it was mind-numbing... it really was... i should just go back to just peeking-in occasionally... i feel like i have nothing to say these days... and it doesn't make me smile, the way it used to do... i think it's best if i stay away from that place... i'd only bother chatting if you or kim wanted to say hello to me...<br><br>i didn't manage to write anything for you or narissa yesterday... i was feeling really tired, and still do really... i will try again tonight or tomorrow... then see if i can send them on monday... i should be able to manage that... i think... if i try hard enough... i got you a couple of magazines too... you said you wanted the 'Q' article... i was going to scan it, but it's a bit much to do that... so i'm going to send you that and another one called 'uncut'... that's got lots of old 'unpublished' pictures in it, and a rather long article... so i thought it would be easier to just send a copy too...<br><br>my site? erm... it's kinda finished... i did most of the work a while ago... it just needs finishing off now... unfortunately, i haven't been in the right frame of mind for the past two weeks... i really don't care about much, at the moment... i've hardly done any work either... in many ways i've just ground to a halt... but i will try to get the site sorted this weekend too... yeah... maybe... ummm... time is not a problem - i have too much of it... getting the motivation to do something is the problem right now... i am really fucked-up... i'm finding it really difficult to function normally...  :-(<br><br>not done much, so far today... i've been mostly reading the papers - catching up on the stuff from genoa -  and listening to 'the rolling stones'... the late sixties stuff...'sympathy for the devil' and 'gimme shelter'... *jumps about*  ;-)<br><br>i rather liked 'supergrass' once... and they were pretty good at oxford... i think their second album is their best... the one with 'richard III' on it... can't remember the name now...<br><br>'the psychedelic furs' were incredible... and yeah, he really does have the most amazing voice... i still love the first couple of albums they made - really intense, crazed music... 'dumb waiters' is one of my all-time favourites... kim really loves them too... and utterly adores richard butler... she said he was like a really adorable version of john lydon... kim actually lived in a squat near kings cross in the late seventies, and the band used to rehearse in a room above the place - before anyone knew about them... so she met them all before they got signed-up and went out gigging... and she still has a massive crush on richard... hehe...  ;-)<br><br>yeah, we both myself and kim have a great love of all the 'new wave' stuff from around that time... it's one of the reasons why we got on so well, from the very start... there was always plenty to chat about... it amazed me how we love so many of the same things... and this is also one of the reasons why i miss her so badly... even as just a friend... she's just so great to talk with... always lots of fun... i used to love hearing all about her various adventures... i really miss all that chatting...  :-(<br><br>of course, i miss chatting to you too... but i know that you're far too busy for all my nonsense at the moment... hehe... i do like this correspondence though... it's nice to have this kind of conact once again... i don't know how i'd manage without you... you are being really nice, lisa... it does help... reading your messages, and being able to write back to you... this means such a lot to me... thanks again, sweet angel... *big warm hug* and yes, i will send your parcel...  ;-)<br><br>byebye for now... lots of love... x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>grdn.<br><br>

kim, please read...
<br><br>kim,<br><br><br>i'm not sure if you check here anymore to see if you have any messages or not. i know that i can't send you an email, or phone you, so this is now my only way of attempting to contact you.<br><br>sorry... i'm really upset, so this message might sound very strange...<br><br>what's wrong?<br><br>you said you'd call me, but you didn't... i've tried sending you a few text messages since, but you still didn't call or reply... i saw you on the board - earlier today - chatting to karen and a few others... you didn't ask for me... but i was there...<br><br>i'm assuming - from what you said to karen - that you never want to speak to me again...<br><br>i don't understand exactly what i've done to make you want to ignore me... i knew you needed some space - and that you wouldn't be in touch every day - but i never thought that you'd just cut me off completely... i remember that you asked me about this before you stopped calling me - about if i would cope with us just being friends... and i said that i'd have to cope, somehow... but that i'd only manage this if you kept in touch with me, and if we could still be really close friends...<br><br>i may be completely wrong and totally insecure and paranoid right now, but i just can't think of any other reason why you'd never contact me... unless it was deliberate...  :-(<br><br>i'm sorry if i am wrong, but this silence is killing me...<br><br>i'm quite sure now that this is a decision you made before last speaking to me... but i don't understand what i've done to annoy you so much... i know that something had definately changed when i met you at oxford... i know you said that paul had come home early that morning and upset you... my ill health was making me feel shit... and there was an uneasy atmosphere, because i didn't have a clue what i could say in front of your nephew... but i knew there was something else wrong... and when you didn't contact me after oxford i assumed that it was all my fault... and that you'd never speak to me again...<br><br>somehow, you seemed to completely change your mind about me - for whatever reason, i'm not really sure - i guess there must be something dreadfully wrong with me... something really awful... but when we last spoke, you said that you still loved me, that you wanted me to remain your friend, that you'd call me again after the weekend and would stay in touch... that was almost two weeks ago... since then, i haven't heard a thing...<br><br>i know that paul is living there again, and is probably trying to treat you all really well... maybe you haven't had a chance to contact me... i'm guessing that this complete contradiction of what you said to me before, is because you just couldn't deal with the tension anymore... i know you said you were ill again... maybe i'm missing something... but you told me that you couldn't bare having him near you - that he was driving you insane - and that your son couldn't stand him being about the place... i just don't understand why this is suddenly all acceptable now...<br><br>i thought you wanted to get out of that situation?<br><br>i also thought that you loved me... when you kissed me, and held me tight, i thought you really meant it... i thought that, for once in my life, my luck had changed...  :-(<br><br>i didn't want to 'hassle' you on the board today, because i don't want to make you feel more awkward than i already have... but i am getting desperate to speak to you now...<br><br>i noticed that you said you don't have aim anymore... i can't email you... you aren't replying to my text messages... and i promised that i would never phone you at home...<br><br>so, that's it... i'm completely fucked...<br><br>all i've been able to do is just wait... and wait... and wait...<br><br>i can't think straight... i just wanted to discuss things with you, and find out what was wrong... you said that you weren't pissed off with me... but i'm assuming from what i read on the board earlier, that you actually are completely fed up with me...<br><br>i don't understand why... i thought that you cared about me?<br><br>i love you kim, i really care about you and i only want you to be happy... i've always been there for you, whenever you wanted me... i've always done whatever you asked of me... but i can't cope with this deadly silence... i don't know what i'm meant to do... it's tearing me up inside...<br><br>am i wrong? do you still want us to be friends? do you intend to stay in touch with me? do you still want to see me again?<br><br>or is this it?<br><br>just a deafening silence... forever...<br><br>i hope i'm wrong kim... and i hope you don't think badly of me for writing this rubbish... i've only ever wanted to make you happy... i just wish i knew what you think of me, and why you haven't got in touch with me...<br><br>surely you must understand what this is doing to me? ...you know how sensitive i am to this kind of thing... it's fucking heartbreaking... i feel as if you've abandoned me, when i really need a friend... you've just vanished... and i don't know what to do...<br><br>am i really that bad, that you want nothing to do with me anymore?<br><br>you said that you were going to florida for two weeks, at the beginning of august... i'm just hoping that you'll reply to me before then... please will you reply?<br><br>would you be prepared to write to me, for the time being, via this mailbox?<br><br>i can't stand the thought of losing you now... that i'll never see you, or hear from you again... i really can't cope with that... you mean far too much to me, and we've shared too much for everything to simply die like this... i just wish you'd contact me somehow...<br><br>i guess i must be really stupid, to think that someone as beautiful, gorgeous, and so unique as you would have ever been interested in me... i must be a complete idiot...<br><br>*cries heart out*  :-(<br><br><br>gordon.<br><br><br>:'-(<br><br>

<br><br>heya lisa!<br><br><br>my angel survived... yay!!! *big hug*  :-D<br><br>it's wonderful to hear back from you... so glad to know you've been having a bit of fun this weekend... hehe... viva las vegas!!!  ;-)<br><br>yes, i am going out early in the morning to get myself copies of the new rh cds... so, when i get back, i will be able to make you a compilation cd of the recent b-sides... i don't think they are releasing any single in the states until late in the month, so you should get to hear them a bit sooner this way... that's if i get my act together tomorrow.  :-S<br><br>awwwwww... you still think i'm an angel do you? hmm... well, maybe... it feels really good to think you might do... *goes all shy again*<br><br>oh dear... this week is going to be 'hell' is it? awww... well, at least it's all for a good cause... a nice week-long break, away from it all... sounds good...  ;-)<br><br>another girl on the board?<br><br>hmmm... i don't know quite what to make of her... she seemed really into talking about all this stuff... even gave me her email address, so i could chat to her in private... erm... don't think i'll be playing any more of those 'games' somehow... it really is the last thing i want... but i did send her a quick message - after pausing for an eternity... just a kind of guarded 'hello' really... i think she's only young too... uggghhh... no, i really don't need this atall... i need friendship and love... the last thing on my mind at the moment is 'virtual naughtiness'... i don't understand why i attract this attention... especially when - right now - i just can't cope with it...  :-(<br><br>am i really 'lovely'? ...i just don't know about myself anymore, maybe i never have! ...you're right about me having to rely on the kind words and approval of others... i have so little confidence left in myself... i feel so bloody useless...<br><br>'cinnamon girl' is really good btw... you should hear it, if you haven't... a classic neil young track... rh do a good version of it, despite saying that they 'butchered' it!  ;-)<br><br>my 'cinnamon girl' is somewhere in florida - i expect... i don't know if i have lost her yet... but it certainly feels like i have - even though i never let go... actually, it feels more as if i've been 'discarded'... that's the only way i can describe it... especially when the person who 'discarded' me, still means so much... i really could cry myself to death right now... and i have to go through this utter agony for two whole weeks, before i have any possibilty of hearing from her again... and she may still decide not to contact me, after that... if that happens, i really will be completely screwed...<br><br>i seem to have allowed myself to fall into this huge emotional trap... fucking stupid, aren't i? ...the fact is, i just can't cope with this 'loss'.<br><br>alcohol and chocolate seems like a rather yummy, yet sickly combination... i haven't tried either for a while... actually i haven't done much for a while... i'm not doing brilliant right now... i'm still not eating or sleeping properly yet... i keep having these dreadful dreams, where i find myself abandoned and lost... they really amplify the feelings i have right now - to a deafening level... for once, i actually wish that i wasn't able to dream atall... these images and feelings hurt me so much...  :-(<br><br>oh, btw... drinking plenty of water and relaxing... that was your wonderful advice to me, which i am merely returning in your direction... i hope it does the trick...<br><br>i'm glad i make you smile... that makes me feel a little happier... it's such a pity i can't see your smile... it's one of those gorgeous things i miss about having kim around... her addictive laughter and adorable smile... all i can do now is remember these things... remember how i made her happy, and how she made me hapy too...  :-(<br><br>ack!!! ...i am moaning again!!!<br><br>thanks for thinking of me, my angel... i'd love to be able to chat to you too... it's so good to know that i am still in your thoughts... you are very patient and incredibly kind to me... i know i shouldn't rely on others words... but knowing how much you care for me, helps me a lot... i don't know what i'd have done without you... i can't imagine it somehow...<br><br>*big hug*<br><br>send me a message if you want me to come wandering on to the 'bored'... you know i'll come running...  :-)<br><br>thanks again for being so wonderful... *kiss*<br><br>i'll try to be happy...<br><br>byebyefornow... lots of love... x x x x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>gordon.<br><br>

<br><br>hey lisa,<br><br><br>here's something which might make you smile this morning...<br><br>i got an email from missy, earlier today...<br><br>- - -<br><br>Now, tell me a bit about my new slave. If you are good for your mistress, she shall reward you. If you are bad, she shall have to discipline you. I am a fair mistress. I will always try to treat you well.<br>I am 29, and live in Texas. I have a boyfriend but we have a good and trusting relationship. He doesn't ask, and I don't tell. I guess your mistress is a bit of a bad girl. I am on the board almost every weeknight. I have a pic if you want one. It's attached to some art pics you will have to ignore, but it is a rare photo of yours truly smiling. I don't really like having my photo taken so, I usually grimace or scowl into the camera. Damn, I sound awful wishy-washy for a mistress.....blurgh, it's Monday. <br>Well then.......write me back or you will receive virtual spankings daily til you do!<br> <br>*smacks your ass with the riding crop playfully*<br>To give you something to think about til you respond :)<br> <br>*smack, kiss, smack*,<br>Maxine<br><br>- - -<br><br>ooooooooops!  :-S<br><br>hmm... so... i'm wondering... do i reply to this, or suffer the consequences?<br><br>erm... heh.<br><br>byebyefornow... lotsoflove... x x x x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>gordon.<br><br>

hey hey!<br><br>guess what?  my trauma doctor DID give me a lovely tape yesterday, which kept me from the bored in the morning.  THEN.......... when all was calm and i was caught up......... i went and got a cup of coffee... settling in for a nice chat.  logged on to the bored........ and GUESS WHAT?????????????????????  I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO SPILL THE WHOLE FRIGGIN' CUP O' COFFEE ON MY KEYBOARD.  no kidding.  i could NOT believe it.  i still can't.  i had a nice microsoft curved ergonomic keyboard that i had gotten quite used to.  well, needless to say, my lovely keyboard was not happy with the injection of caffeine.  i cant imagine why.  and so i spent the next couple of hours digging through closets trying to find where i had stored the old... TINY keyboard the computer came with.  THEN.... when i managed to find it..... i had to actually use the stupid thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  by this time i had loads of work piled up and this keyboard is almost half the size of the old one and i cant type on it properly anymore.  :S<br><br>shit.<br><br>so...........   *sigh*<br><br>actually today is turning out to be relatively easy.  usually my tuesday are a nightmare, but i am nearly caught up.  there will be more later, but for now i have a bit of a break.  so i thought i write ya.<br><br>so you are working on a compilation for me??  awwww!  now gordon... honest to god.  is this going to be sent?  i have nearly given up on you you know.  i still have not seen jools holland or any of the lovely things you have promised. tell me when you will send this and i will hold you to it.<br><br>now......... regarding this bluerose??  ummm...  not sure what to tell ya.  sounds like a bit o fun as long as you dont get attached in any way, know what i mean?  i am not familiar with her... but she sounds nice enough i suppose!  hehehe...  and are you still talking with nari?  you had better not have sent her parcel!  you promised me mine a good 5 months before even CHATTING with her.  why do i still talk to you anyway... you are mean to me.  ;p<br><br>i just lurked for a moment on the board and didn't see you there.  didn't really feel like posting.  shoot me back an email if you are around and feel like a chat.  i will be sitting here for a couple more hours me thinks!  :/<br><br>sorry to hear that you have not heard from kim.  i dont know what to say. i still think that maybe it is best this way.  you must take better care of yourself though... honestly!!  make sure you are eating and sleeping!!!!!!<br><br>i am going to go and have a cup o coffee in the OTHER room before embarking on the second leg of my typing adventure today.  :/<br><br>hope you are having a nice day and talk to you soon!<br><br>lisa

oh, but i love women with riding crops!
<br><br>heya!!!<br><br><br>awww... it's my wonderful, sweet angel.<br><br>*big hugs*<br><br>yeah, i guessed that you've been busy. ooh... bad luck about the keyboard drenching... good excuse to get a nice brand-spanking-new one though! (for some reason, the word 'spanking' excites me... i need help!). actually, i almost managed that the other day too. fortunately, i only threw the coffee over the desk... so no real damage done. i don't know how i did it either, i think it's because my nerves are all shot right now... i keep doing strange things - forgetting how to perform very basic functions... hmm... maybe i'm losing my mind a little...  :-S<br><br>*deep sigh*<br><br>thanks for writing to me. it makes me very happy, to read something you've written.  :-)<br><br>tell you about your parcel?<br><br>hmm... well, yeah... i made that amnesiac b-sides e.p. thingy, and i made a cover for it too. now, the thing is... i recorded an interview with thom yesterday, on the tv. - it wasn't especially brilliant, but it was rather funny watching his reactions to some of the daft questions... anyhow, i'm going to put that on the end of your 'jools holland' tape, because there's some space left... also... they are meant to be on 'top of the pops' this thursday, doing 'knives out' (i've already put the last 'totp' thingy - 'pyramid song' - on after the 'jools' show). sooooooooo... i'm thinking that maybe i should put that on the tape too, before i send it... is that a good idea, or do you want to hit me very hard? i reckoned - seeing as how you are going to have to get these tapes 'converted' - that you should have plenty to watch, at the end of it all.<br><br>hmm... you said you are on holiday next week. how about if i send it this friday, that way you will have something there when you return? is that alright?<br><br>*cowers*<br><br>erm... 'bluerose'... oh, how did you know her board name? *gets all paranoid...*<br><br>well, i wrote back to maxine - it seemed impolite not to - and she replied again today... hmm... well, it seems that she's really into sm, and it's not just a game for her... but i definately won't be getting 'attached'... don't worry about that... in any case, it's completely impossible for me to deal with anything right now... and when there are no feelings - behind the words - it all seems rather pointless... i guess i'll just write occasionally... she works nights, and is on the board when i'm just getting up in the morning... so i don't really get a chance to chat... it's just interesting to write to someone about this stuff... someone who understands, maybe... uggghhh... dunno... maybe not...  :-S<br><br>i'm thinking that perhaps i should keep off that board - and the net - more often... the average person would tell me to just get out and enjoy myself more often... but that's easy to say, not so easy to do... i don't feel like i want to share anything with anybody right now... not even conversation... certainly not with virtual strangers... i can't just talk crap - even at the best of times... and if i'm going to cry, i'd much rather be alone - than in a busy and unfamiliar environment... i don't think i'm much fun right now - i'm terribly introverted at the moment... anyway, i've tried that 'going out' lark many times before and just got terribly depressed by who i met... i often feel more alone in a room full of people... knowing my luck, i'd end up meeting some bloody weirdo too... that's what i used to do... oh, i don't know what i should be doing... i'm bloody lost... blaaahhhhhhhhh...<br><br>i haven't heard from nari since last week... she's been on the board a couple of times just to say hello... things are going fine, it seems... she won't be back home for another week... so i will send her parcel when i've sent yours... anyway, nari already has a pressie from england... she collected him from the airport last week....  ;-)<br><br>am i really mean to you? awwwwwwwww... i wish you didn't think that...  :-(<br><br>uggghhh... i don't feel good today... haven't felt good for a while... my enthusiasm for everything has simply evaporated... i try to sleep... i try to eat... i try to do many things... i just keep failing...<br><br>i was on the board earlier... didn't you see me? ...i only post as 'grdn' or 'eek!' at the moment... i don't feel like being a mouse anymore... not since... hmmm...<br><br>i'd really love to chat with you lisa, but i know you're far too busy right now... hopefully one day we can do that again... i miss chatting with you... oh, i sound so damn selfish... don't i???<br><br>*kicks self*<br><br>kim is on holiday in florida, as far as i know... so there isn't any possibilty of hearing from her for maybe another couple of weeks... believe me, lisa... this is definately not the best way... i can't even begin to get over what i feel i've lost, until i know for sure that i have... or understand why i have... gaaawwwwwwddd... i miss her so much!!! ...this is killing me.  :-(<br><br>it just completely freaks me out... for once, i thought i'd found someone i could really be happy with... we seemed so perfectly matched in almost every way... and i got so incredibly close to her... this whole thing was so intense... then, suddenly, it all vanished - virtually within a week... and i still don't really understand what went wrong... i don't know what else i could have done to make her happy... she said that she loved me... now, it seems, i'm nothing...<br><br>you know what i did today?<br><br>this is how stupid i am right now... i got a message on my mobile... and kim is the only person who would send me a text message... i almost passed out... then i opened it... just an advert from the mobile network... i burst into tears... oh, i'm so fucking dumb... and this is the way my brain is working at the moment... totally useless... i can't cope...  :-(<br><br>sorry... you must be sick of me... all i do is moan about things... i just feel so numb... i could do with a really big hug... for about a week, i think... but there's no one to give it to me... and the person i really need to talk with, appears to have abandoned me for good...<br><br>it rained heavily today, and yesterday too... so it smells really nice around here... that's about the good only thing i've noticed today... and you wrote to me... that makes me happy... it always does...<br><br>okay, i should stop this nonsense, and let you get on with things... thanks for putting up with me... many wouldn't... i'm quite sure they wouldn't... but, you are very special... i hope you realise how much i still care for you, and always will...  :-x<br><br>please write to me again, if and when you can... i'm going to miss you so much, next week... *big warm hugs*<br><br>byebyefornow... lots of love... x x x x x x<br><br><br>:-x<br><br><br>gordon.<br><br>

hey gordon...... i am not NOT speaking to you.  i didn't even realize you had sent a message about the yahoo chatroom until about 11o'clock at night.  my day absolutely EXPLODED with work and i ended up working until very, very late at night.  sorry.<br><br>but i swear to god i am going to "boycott" you if my parcel is not here when i return home!!!  be a good friend and send it to me... *lays HUGE amounts of guilt on you*.  i am not "above" emotional bribery!  ;)<br><br>i am sorry that kim has "deleted" you from her life.  i am rather surprised that you did not guess this already.  i felt it from reading what you wrote me, about what she said on the board and what she said to you.  i think that maybe oxford shouldve been a sign of things to come.  i dont know.  it is easy to look from the outside in.  i do still think it is best this way, no matter what you say.  a clean break is always the best way... everything is best remembered how it was at the "high point". the longer you draw everything out, the worse it gets.  you must move on and remember what a wonderful moment it was in your life, but that it simply was not meant to be a life long thing.  you must be grateful for having it at all... and move on from there.<br><br>i am sorry this is so difficult for you.  <br><br>i must go and get some work done and get ready for my vacation.  so many things to do....  ugh.  i am REALLY looking forward to a holiday with no work!<br><br>i will be here for at least a few more hours.  i will try and check my emails if you would like to talk some more.<br><br>:)

<br><br>good morning, sweetheart...<br><br><br>i'm thinking about you again... loving thoughts...<br><br>i want to hold you in my arms, caress your gorgeous lips and gaze deeply into those beautiful blue eyes of  yours. i long to lay with you, to watch you slowly drift off into sleep... then i'd like to watch you again as you awake. you'd see me gazing directly into your eyes, you'd smile warmly, stroke my face gently and kiss me tenderly on the lips. then i'd whisper softly... tell you about all my dreams, and how much you mean to me...<br><br>that's what i've been thinking about this morning.<br><br>i wanted to share it with you... and i thought you might like it, too.<br><br>have a wonderful day, my angel... i'll be thinking of you a lot today. i miss you, and can hardly wait to chat with you once again...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br>i adore you...<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

please excuse my endless rambling...
<br><br>hey gorgeous!<br><br><br>thinking about you again...<br><br>gazing into those beautiful blue eyes of yours...<br><br>i'm so glad that you love the things i say to you... i adore the words you use too...<br>i still find it difficult to believe that nobody has ever said anything like this to you before... i can't be that unique in my romantic or naughty thoughts, surely?<br>you deserve to hear such beautiful words and read them every single day of your life, my angel... you are so precious and have such a warm, open heart... i find it hard to believe that nobody has discovered and appreciated this before...<br><br>you are special... *warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br>these days, i find i am thinking about you constantly...<br><br>i also wish i was closer to you... one day soon this will happen, i'm sure of it... we just need a little more time... and there's always plenty of that...<br><br>you sensed that i had something on my mind... i do... it's all a little complex for me, although it may sound quite straightforward to someone else...<br><br>i'm sorry... because it's probably going to be more than just a little long-winded, this message...<br><br>okay...<br><br>i fell in love with someone (well, i mean we both fell in love)... as a result of the internet... someone who i can never be with... and i need to get used to just being a really close friend to them... i'm still a little lost in the whole thing...<br><br>so... i fell in love, not long ago, with a beautiful woman across the other side of the world... america, to be exact... we were friends and we met through the internet, much in the same as we did... and we spent a lot of time exchanging thoughts and comments by email... and then later through internet chat, as we do... she fell in love with me first, whilst i felt like a reluctant bystander - watching everything unfold, yet unable to grasp what was happening... she is married and has a young child... i held back my emotions, because it didn't seem right or fair to become so deeply involved... but eventually i fell... i fell from a great height and was madly in love... this i know will seem bizarre, considering that neither of us had ever actually 'met'... but, somehow, being able to exchange so much information and respond so instantly, and to not be afraid of saying anything to each other... to be able to lay our hearts bare... it made the bond so tight, and so close that it truely hurt like hell to be apart... both physically and mentally... we communicated every day, online and through messages... we became so close that we completely lost sight of the reality of the situation... <br><br>we knew each other for months before we actually sent each other pictures, so we could look into each other's eyes and dream... then, one night she decided that she had to hear me speak... i was concerned whether i would be able to do it or not... but she persuaded me to do so, and i called her... i heard her voice on the answerphone and left her a message... i was so excited that i could hardly speak... the whole situation seemed unreal... then she called me and did the same... we were both in fits of giggles and so high about everything at that point... suddenly i think it hit her... she was talking to a stranger on the other side of the world... who she had fallen madly in love with, but only knew me by my words, my picture and my voice... and because we had spent so long 'chatting' without knowing much about what we looked or sounded like, i think it shocked her to realise that i wasn't the same person she'd obviously built-up in her head... this was something i hadn't really done, myself... and i was delighted to see her face and hear from her at long last... plus i think at that point, that was the moment when i really did fall completely in love with her... that night we were 'together' for what seemed like an eternity... she struggled to make sense of everything and was terribly upset... this made me extremely upset too, for some reason... <br><br>i don't think i'd cried for a long time before that point, but that night i really was in tears... one moment i was ecstatic, the next thoroughly torn to shreds inside... she did a lot of soul-searching and soon after decided that we couldn't carry on behaving like this... that the whole situation was impossible... which, of course, is true... what was happening with me was destroying her relationship with her family - that she loves so dearly - every time her husband came home from a week's work she said he noticed her changing... so she took time out and decided that she had to find a way to reconnect with her home life, without also ruining our incredible relationship... see, none of this had happened intentionally, or was instigated by either of us... i often felt that we weren't actually making conscious decisions, but rather that we'd both fallen into each other's hearts blindly, and we were too happy with all the emotion and attention that we couldn't stop falling deeper and deeper into each other...<br><br>so this was all months ago now... we still chat regularly and send each other messages... but, of course, it's difficult now... we do both still love each other, although she decided that she could only  find a way back into her own life was by closing a door to me... the door which led directly to her heart... so nowadays i rarely know how or what she feels for me... the interaction for a long time after was all one way - in terms of romantic gestures... now, i've all but given-up trying to deceive my mind about this situation... i no longer send my special thoughts... or my heartfelt emotions... because i know - even though it hurts her - that she cannot reciprocate such feelings anymore...<br><br>we want to remain the very closest of friends... we share such a lot - things we both love to read, to hear and experience - and we've shared more than our hearts with each other... i'm sure we even managed to touch each other's souls... the feelings i get when we chat are still the same... the heart aches and i choke on my emotions, whenever we talk about our 'relationship'... the rest of the time we are just as we want to be... like best friends, who've known each other for years... we've barely known each other for half that time... but it truely feels like we have... the amount of words we've exchanged and feelings we've expressed is probably as much as many good friends or lovers do in an entire year or more... that's how intense the whole thing was...<br><br>and now... we are both a little lost... i know i certainly am... learning to make the adjustments to cope with the whole situation hasn't been easy atall... and it still isn't... we both still feel the same, yet it can do us no good atall... it's a dream of an incredible love that can never be realised... we came so close, and yet have never even met each other... and i believe that human beings haven't developed enough to be able cope with the situations that this new technology affords us... certainly not this, anyhow... so we both still struggle on... trying desperately to come to terms with everything...<br><br>then one day i 'met' you... i was so happy to find someone who truely understood my desires... i never realised we'd become this close, not for a second... but each day i feel myself being drawn closer to you... i can feel it in my heart now, when we part... i feel a great sense of loss...<br><br>now, i'm sure after reading about by previous experience you have already drawn some conclusions about me, and why i might be so interested in you also... please don't... i appreciate you for who you are... i'm not simply shifting my sense of loss and need for love onto you... i couldn't do such a thing... the fact is that i am still, to all intents and purposes, in love with someone else... although it seems bizarre to suggest so... and yet being with you gives me so much hope, so much happiness and so much pleasure... i'm quite sure that i feel myself being drawn closer and closer to your heart... and i don't want to stop either... but this is where i know i'll need time... i really need to deal with all these contradictions rolling about inside my head and my heart right now... it would be so unfair of me to claim that 'i love you' and that i wanted to be with you right now... because i still don't really know what i think or feel anymore... i'm so mixed-up right now, emotionally...<br><br>my love/friend understands... she even encourages me, whenever there's the faintest possibilty of me finding someone i can really be happy with... i sometimes think she feels it's her obligation to find me someone else to love... although she still feels she is holding me back in some way... preventing me from finding someone i can be with... she still blames herself terribly for all that has happened, even though she was never really at fault... i obviously filled a void in her life at that moment, and gave her something that she hadn't - or hadn't for a long time - experienced... she still makes me happy, and i try to make her happy too... with kind words and reassurance... <br><br>i do hope that you understand some of this, kim... and that you don't feel atall jealous or unnerved by this... as far as myself and her are both concerned our 'passionate relationship' is now long over, and only the memories remain... we are both desperately trying to keep our heads and maintain a really wonderful friendship after all that has happened... i do hope you undestand... you are the only person i ever speak to in such a way now, and to whom i express such emotion and desire...<br><br>i just wanted to be straight with you and explain for once and only, i hope, why i may seem a little... erm... as if i am 'holding back' or something... it's merely my past experience of such things, coming to the fore, when i'm feeling doubtful or insecure... i am a very emotional and sensitive person... i do take matters of love very seriously indeed... i wouldn't want you to think i wasn't ever being anything but completely honest with my feelings for you at any time...<br><br>you were such an angel to explain your situation to me early on... and your desire to move on and find some greater happiness in life, that maybe you feel you have been left without... i am so glad that i make you happy right now... i hope that one day i can make you even happier... i do hope you still feel the same way as you have told me you do... i so adore us 'being together' in whatever way possible... right now, unfortunately that's via a very long set of wires... but not forever... i also hope you understand why i am so reluctant to visit you, whilst you are still in a relationship, in some way - and whilst i am also trying to deal with the after effects of a previous 'love affair' (if you can call it such a thing)... i do care for you so deeply... and i mean everything i say, and how i say it... if i felt i could say them with total confidence, i would use those three most magical words for you too... and i will... but only when i can be sure that i really mean them... until then, please accept everything else i do say - with the kindness, love, warmth and affection they are intended to convey...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*tender loving kisses*<br><br>byebyefornow... my beautiful angel.<br><br><br>i adore you.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

sweet, romantic thoughts in the afternoon...
<br><br>hey sweet baby,<br><br><br>here's your second message of the day...<br><br>sorry the first one wasn't there when you got up this morning... i hope that i didn't make you late for work, reading all my words... glad you left happy though... didn't like the idea of you feeling rejected or let down, or something... you know that i never want to let that happen... don't you?<br><br>i was thinking of what i'd like to write, on this very pleasant sunny day... so i thought i'd meet you in a nice peaceful park during your lunch break... we'd both walk there alone, and meet at the entrance... i'd make sure that i was there early, so i could watch you arrive - looking gorgeous... i'd hold you tightly and kiss you tenderly... then we'd walk hand-in-hand into the park... gazing into each others eyes in the brilliant sunlight... whispering beautiful thoughts in each others ears... and kissing each other gently...<br><br>we'd reach a certain place in the park - somewhere pleasant in the shade, where the grass looked beautiful and freshly-mown... we'd sit together, smiling warmly and holding each other close... completely infatuated with each other... i'd be staring deep into your eyes and telling you how much i care for you... telling you how beautiful you look, and how wonderful it is to be able to spend this moment with you... that i never want to leave... that i just want to stay here, forever by your side...<br><br>you'd hold my face gently and caress it with your hands, and kiss me passionately... and we'd lay together... like young lovers, oblivious to our surroundings... kissing each other until we are both absolutely breathless... our hearts full of love and desire... our eyes full of wonder, sparkling with light and energy... we'd spend the whole of your lunch break there, together... then you'd skip away, giggling like a child... and before you left me, you would turn and blow a kiss in my direction... then i'd watch you race away, just in time to return to work... your clothing still holding a few blades of fresh, green grass... and on your face, you'd be wearing the biggest smile in the world...<br><br>hehe... that's all for now... i hope you liked that... i guess it's kinda sweet and romantic... but i like it a lot... *kiss*<br><br>i'll try to think of something a little more passionate for this evening...<br><br>*big warm hugs and long wet kisses*<br><br>i adore you, my beautiful angel.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

my sweet angel...
<br><br>hi sweetheart,<br><br><br>thanks for talking with me last night. i know at times it was difficult, and i was quite useless at responding to you about what was on my mind, but thanks for staying with me. please never think that i won't want to speak to you again. this is just not true. whatever gets discussed, or however i respond to certain things, even if i get upset about something, i will always want to talk to you again. i care for you so much. every moment i spend 'with' you is so precious to me. every single word you speak or write brings me closer to you. i can feel it, deep inside my heart. please do not doubt the sincerity of what i say. i would never say anything to you that i did not mean.<br><br>*hugs*<br><br>i really love talking with you... sharing our thoughts... listening to the sound of your voice... and hearing you gently breathe. it is absolutely gorgeous!<br><br>i realise that sometimes it feels awkward, and i know that i am often to blame for this... being unable to see the look in your eyes, or the expression on your face... having only sound, or words, and only one image of your face in my head... it's so difficult, sometimes, to put certain feelings and thoughts into words...<br><br>words mean so much, but i know they are never enough.<br><br>*kiss*<br><br>we will meet though. this is now absolutely clear. i will meet you before the oxford gig. i will be so nervous and excited - all at once. it will be an incredible day and an incredible moment... i hope.<br><br>sorry i didn't write anything really gorgeous or sexy this morning... i wasn't really sure what to write.<br><br>i just wanted you to know how much i care for you, and that i think of you all day long.<br><br>right now i'm thinking about watching you wander about, getting ready for work... as i gaze at you adoringly, smile warmly, and feel my heart race every time you are close to me... just blissful.<br><br>*tender loving kisses*<br><br>speak to you later, my beautiful angel.<br><br>i adore you.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

good luck, my sweetheart...
<br><br>hello gorgeous,<br><br><br>i'm thinking about you... trying to imagine how you feel, all wrapped up and snug in bed... what naughty little thoughts you are dreaming about... what it's like to hear you gently breathe, and listen to the beating of your heart. *hugs*<br><br>i loved our nice little chat last night. i'm so glad that you persuaded me to come and see you before we meet again in oxford. i often have this beautiful, romantic dream about our first meeting at a railway station. i always secretly wished for it to happen. of course, i will be so incredibly nervous - yet also completely excited - by the whole prospect of meeting you in this way... it could turn out to be a dream come true.<br><br>i can hardly wait to kiss you passionately on your delicious red lips... to hold you tightly in my arms and tell you how much i love you... to walk with you in the park and chat for hours... smiling with joy... loving every single moment we are together. i want to run with you, hand-in-hand, through a rainstorm - allowing the cool, sparkling raindrops to drench us completely... then, when we got home, i could lay with you for hours... we'd keep each other warm, and i'd lick every single drop of water from your beautiful, naked body... *kiss*<br><br>you are irresistable. i love you and adore you. you are so beautiful and kind-hearted. you say things which give me the most incredible feelings... i dare not dream how good it is to actually be with you, as you say these words - or do such things... i'm sure it would just be absolute bliss.<br><br>i hope that things go okay for you today, and that you don't get too upset by whatever is said. stay strong, give back whatever you get, and be firm. don't doubt yourself, or allow yourself to waver. you know what you want to do by now, i think. it's about time you had some real love and affection in your life. you deserve all the happiness in the world. remember, i'll be thinking of you... all day long.<br><br>i will try to write you another message or two today, so you can read them if you can't come and chat with me.<br><br>i care for you so much, my angel...<br><br>i'm going to miss you terribly today.<br><br>*big warm hugs and deep wet kisses*<br><br>i love you.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i hope you had a good sleep last night. our little chat was absolutely gorgeous. i feel so close to you, my heart races whenever i get the chance to talk with you. you are so gorgeous. i am so lucky to have found you.<br><br>i'm sorry, because i haven't finished typing-up my 'naughty' fantasy yet. there's a lot more text involved than i'd thought there would be... hehe... i'll hopefully have it finished soon and send it separately, so you can read it when you get in from work. i was going to paste in a small section, but i think you'd probably want to read the whole thing rather than just a short passage. *hugs*<br><br>i just want you to know that i've been thinking of you constantly since last night, and i miss you terribly again. i had a wonderful time in the shower, dreaming up the gorgeous little fantasy i am currently writing for you. it made me extremely hot and bothered... i couldn't keep my hands off myself... it felt incredible. *kiss*<br><br>i'll be waiting for you to come and pounce on me, later this evening. i rather like the idea of you grabbing me unexpectedly, and doing whatever you desire to me. i wouldn't complain, that's for sure! i bet you look adorable when you prowl about, hehe... i'll stop... i'm feeling naughty now... i want you baby.<br><br>okay, i'm going to put this in your inbox now, before you feel dissapointed by having nothing to read yet again. as i said, there's better to come later on. well, i hope it's good anyhow!<br><br>speak to you soon...<br><br>*big warm hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

i'm a very naughty boy...
<br><br>hiya gorgeous,<br><br><br>you are so adorable. you make me feel very special. you said that you wanted me to send you something naughty to read. i don't know if this quite fits the bill, but i rather like it anyhow. i hope you like it too. *hugs and kisses*<br><br><br>mistress calls, and demands my presence in her room...<br><br>i walk in and see you standing over in the far corner - dressed immaculately and wearing a seductive, evil look on your face. i'm stunned. i stand at the door, not daring to move.<br><br>"well... come on in then, before i change my mind... and shut the bloody door you idiot... do you want me to get cold?"<br><br>i do as you say, then walk into the centre of the room and stand motionless. you walk over and slowly pace around me, carefully examining. you hold a black riding crop in your hands, which you brandish intentionally as you walk. you are wearing a beautiful black studded choker around your gorgeous neck... a beautiful shiny black corset - encasing your body tightly - showing a generous amount of cleavage, which pulses deliciously with every move you make... you are also wearing a pair of tight black leather gloves, which come up above your elbows... a pair of black leather panties - looking almost like a chastity belt, with the amount of straps fastening them up... and you strut around in a pair of incredibly vicious-looking shiny black leather high stiletto boots, which come up to just below your knees.<br><br>i am mesmerized by your deep gaze. you stand in front of me and look me directly in the eyes.<br><br>"undress... now!"<br><br>i hurriedly remove my clothes... unbutton my shirt and throw it to the floor, kick off my my shoes and pull off my socks... i begin unbutton my jeans, but you tell me to stop. you prod my naked chest with your riding crop.<br><br>"do it slowly, and properly. i want to watch this, you fool!"<br><br>i apologise: "yes mistress, i'm sorry."<br><br>i carefully unbutton my jeans and slowly push then away from my waist, glancing back to seek your approval. you nod and utter a gentle "hmm...", as i continue to remove my jeans carefully. i kick them away as they fall to the floor. you sneer dismissively - prodding at my limp penis with your crop.<br><br>"not much of any use there, eh? ...what the hell do you expect me to do with that? ...pathetic! aren't you?"<br><br>i slowly nod back.<br><br>"SAY IT! ...go on, tell me what a useless fuck you are!!!"<br><br>i attempt to reply...<br><br>"i'm sorry mistress, i'm a useless pathetic little fuck. i don't deserve your attention."<br><br>you cut me off, as i speak...<br><br>"damn right you don't! ...but let me see if i can use you for something. nothing too demanding of course, you poor brain can't deal with anything too complicated, can it???"<br><br>"no mistress"<br><br>i reply, with my head bowed low.<br><br>"get on the floor, now!"<br><br>you demand, pointing to the floor.<br><br>"kneel down there, quickly!!!"<br><br>"yes mistress" i hastily reply.<br><br>i crouch and fall to my knees in front of you, hurting myself in the rush. you laugh at me, covering your face to hold back your hysterical reaction.<br><br>"you can't do anything right, can you? ...you fool."<br><br>i gaze up at you and frown, as you continue to laugh at my stupidity.<br><br>"i don't want you to be hurting yourself before i've had a chance to deal with you, do i?"<br><br>"no mistress"<br><br>"you won't be much good to me as a slave, if you're going to keep injuring yourself when i ask you to do the most basic things... WILL YOU?"<br><br>"no mistress, i'm sorry mistress"<br><br>"when i want you to feel pain i'll make sure you do... not when you decide to ... do you understand?"<br><br>"yes mistress, i understand"<br><br>"GOOD! ...maybe we'll make some progress if you start doing as i say, for a change."<br><br>i gaze up at you, adoringly.<br><br>you just laugh back at me.<br><br>"don't be getting ideas, boy! ...you can save those looks until you've done something to please me. NOT BEFORE!!!"<br><br>"yes mistress, i'm sorry mistress."<br><br>"i'll wipe that stupid smile off your face!"<br><br>you turn and walk into the corner... rummaging through a cupboard... then you turn and walk back over, holding something in your left hand...<br><br>"i don't want to see that silly grin anymore..."<br><br>you grab my head and hold me by my hair, hurting my scalp badly as you tug. you wrap a dark silk gag around me, over my mouth and pulled tightly into a solid knot behind my ears. i breathe hard through the material, but cannot speak properly. the best i can do is utter a muffled groan.<br><br>"there... that should calm you down for a while... does that feel good?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"that's better..."<br><br>you turn and walk back to the cupboard again and bring out a pair of ankle chains and handcuffs.<br><br>"...and whilst i'm in the mood for tying you up, these will prevent any further interruptions"<br><br>you pull my arms behind my back and cuff them, then lock on the ankle braces.<br><br>"if you're so dumb that you fall flat on your face, you'll have to crawl back on to your knees, because i'm not doing it for you... understand?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"good. that's much better. you look far more useful when you are restrained, it helps to focus your tiny brain on the important things, doesn't it?"<br><br>i nod again.<br><br>i watch as you pace around the room, examining me - all tied-up and completely helpless on the floor. i feel my penis begin to grow erect, as i gaze in your direction.<br><br>"have you been touching yourself again today?"<br><br>i nod.<br><br>"you filthy sod! ...did you do it over a magazine?"<br><br>i shake my head and mumble.<br><br>"were you thinking of me?"<br><br>i nod in agreement.<br><br>"you filthy piece of shit! ...how dare you!!! ...did i say you could do that?"<br><br>i pause, look down, and then shake my head.<br><br>"you know what i said i'd do, if you disobeyed me, don't you?"<br><br>i nod, slowly... gazing at you...<br><br>"and you thought i wouldn't do it, did you? ...you thought i'd overlook your filthy habits?"<br><br>i shake my head and try to mutter 'sorry mistress'.<br><br>"too right!!! ...i'm not letting you off this time. you hopeless fuck!!!"<br><br>you kick me with your stilletto boot and i tumble over backward on to my side, awkwardly. you kick me again, this time in my back, and force me to lay on my stomach by pushing me down on the floor...<br><br>"get your face on the floor, you shit!!! ...and don't fucking move!!!"<br><br>i hear you walk off into the corner, and i stretch my head round to catch sight of what you are doing. you stand in the corner and pick out a really nasty-looking tawse. then you unfasten the belts around your leather panties and remove them - exposing your gorgeous naked buttocks, fully. i turn back as you walk over to me, brandishing the tawse in your gloved hands. you straddle my body, standing over my buttocks... slapping my cheeks lightly, in swift strokes with the tawse, so i can feel a subtle stinging sensation.<br><br>"you feel that?"<br><br>i attempt to reply, but can only mumble.<br><br>"your flesh is remarkably free from wounds. i've been slacking with you, obviously. you're in dire need of a little discipline..."<br><br>i feel you draw back a little, and stop stroking my arse with the tawse... then i feel a warm jet of spray hit my back, and i realise that you are pissing on me. i moan with pleasure as i feel the gorgeous warm spray hit my naked flesh, and trickle down my body...<br><br>"you useless fuck! ...it's all you deserve!"<br><br>i continue to moan as your urine trickles out over my skin... i hear you testing the tawse against your gloved hands... and then i feel the first lash over my back... i gasp hard under the gag.<br><br>"disobedient fuck!!! ...you'll get as many of these as can be bothered with"<br><br>you continue to lash at my damp flesh with the tough leather tawse. as it begins to cut and sting me badly, i start to moan, with a mixture of ecstasy and pain.<br><br>"QUIET!!!"<br><br>i try to muffle my yelps of pain as best i can. i bite in hard on the gag to numb my instinctive reactions. you lash at me a few more times, before you stop... panting heavily from the whipping. as you catch you breath, you snarl back at me...<br><br>"did that hurt???"<br><br>i try to reply, in a muffled groan...<br><br>"i hope you understand now, why you deserve such punishments... why you make me resort to such methods... you need to be taught a few basic lessons, and learn to understand them..."<br><br>i groan in approval...<br><br>"come here, i'm not finished with this yet..."<br><br>you grab my head and pull me up on to my knees again, forcing me to face you... as you do i feel the urine slide down my back and sting at my wounds... i bite hard to numb the pain and close my eyes tightly.<br><br>"now you know what it feels like to disobey me!"<br><br>you grab the knot on my gag and pull it free. i gasp, as i take my first breath of air...<br><br>"open wide!"<br><br>you force my mouth open, then pull me close against your wet vagina - smothering my face once more... i can feel the bittersweet taste of your urine on my lips...<br><br>"i'll let you have what's left... i know how much you love it..."<br><br>you giggle as you begin to piss into my open mouth and down my throat, drenching me completely... almost choking me with your urine...<br><br>"swallow! ...go on ...i want to hear you gulp it down!"<br><br>i swallow a mouthful of your fluid in one go...<br><br>"oh, how adorable... you enjoyed that, didn't you?"<br><br>"yes mistress, thank you mistress."<br><br>you gaze down at my fully erect penis, dripping wet...<br><br>"oh, look at that... that's a bit of an improvement, isn't it?"<br><br>i gaze down...<br><br>"yes mistress."<br><br>"i MIGHT be able to use that for something now... yes..."<br><br>you poke at my hard wet penis with the sharp tip of your boot... i wince a little as you rub against the glistening, exposed head...<br><br>"that could come in handy that little thing..."<br><br>i gaze up at you, looking down at me... examining me carefully... i feel so hot... i want to cum all over you right here and now... but i just kneel below you and attempt to stay still, as my penis grows ever more sensitive...<br><br>"ohhhhhh!!!

...let me taste you!!! ...i want it all, now!!! ...i want a mouthful"<br><br>you continue to masturbate yourself whilst sucking on me again, even harder this time, letting your teeth rub over the tip as you do... driving me insane with pleasure... all i can do is lay still and gasp like crazy... the sensation is too much to bear any longer... you take it out of your mouth once again, and lick the tip... letting your saliva dribble all over the end... lubricating it fully... then you grab my cock again and thrust it into your cleavage, rubbing it in and out between your corset-encased breasts... i want to come right now... but you are holding be so tightly that i can't... even though i'm desperate...<br><br>"come on!!! ...i want it to drench me ...i want to drown in it!!!"<br><br>then you take me back inside you mouth once more and begin to suck harder again... you take your other hand and push your gloved wet forefinger up into my anus... rubbing it in and out violently... and i can no longer stop myself... i'm in absolute ecstasy... i cum inside your mouth... gasping madly as i feel the sensation rush through my entire body... spraying inside you with my hot semen, drenching the back of your throat with cum...<br><br>"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!!!!!"<br><br>you lap up every tiny drop... squeezing out whatever is left inside me.... sucking me dry... then you sit up and stare down at me as you savour the taste in your mouth and quite deliberately swallow... i collapse on the bed... gasping for air... completely exhausted... you continue to touch yourself, as you watch me laying back... gasping like crazy... still feeling your finger deep inside my anus, pushing hard... you begin to gasp loudly... your breathing getting stronger and stronger... i gaze up at you as you masturbate over me... bringing yourself to the point of ecstasy... thrusting into my anus harder as you feel closer and closer to the moment of orgasm... then you pull your finger out suddenly and scream with ecstasy... thrusting provocatively over my body as you come...<br><br>you collapse on top of me, and we lay together in each others arms... both totally fulfilled and happy... i tell you how much i love you, and you hold me tight and tell me that you love me too... we kiss, such tender loving kisses... and we lay like this for hours, just listening to the sound of our hearts pounding with such gorgeous passion... feeling our warm breath on each others bodies... wanting to stay like this forever... completely numb from the waist down... never wanting to leave... we snuggle up close and stay like this all night, locked in our warm embrace... both smiling like crazy... dreaming such beautiful delicious thoughts... wondering whatever will happen next.<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

missing you more, each and every day...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i got up early to write you this little message, because i want you to know how much you mean to me.<br><br>i so wish that you could feel happier about things right now. i guess that you will not really feel better until you have a lot of these current worries dealt with. i just wish that i could help you more right now. it hurts me, being so far away from you at times, because i know that what you really need right now is someone to care for you, to be by your side and comfort you when you are feeling low. i wish i could do that. hopefully soon i will be able to... and hopefully you'll still want me to. you're not the only one who gets paranoid about things. i still have voices in my head telling me that you won't like me, or you'll get bored of me... that i don't deserve such a wonderful, sweet, gorgeous, and kind-hearted woman in my life.<br><br>i'm glad that you enjoy being with me though... that you feel so attatched to me... i need to hear these things sometimes, just to keep myself sane... i really did burst into tears last night when you told me how you couldn't be apart from me, because you love me so much... ohhh... that really hit a nerve... just pure emotion. please never think that i wouldn't want to be with you - all the time - i was only trying to help you... it seems as if i am partly to blame for you being so behind on your school marking... and i don't want you to feel you have to ignore your work to be with me... i'd hate for you to have more stress to deal with, purely because i am with you so often... i only want to be a positive influence... not a destructive one... i love you kim.<br><br>it's nice to know that my fantasy was appreciated... like i said, it's certainly not the most naughty thought i've ever had... but it is the sort of thing i think of quite a lot - in relation to you... you and your oral fetish keep me awake most nights, these days... hehe... i wonder if you'd be able to write one of your fantasies down for me sometime? ...i imagine you have enough to cope with right now though, without more bloody homework! haha... oh well, a nice idea, anyhow... i'll write you another one soon, if you want more filth? hehe...<br><br>i'm missing you, my angel. i want to gaze into those gorgeous bright sparkling blue eyes of yours and fall into a dream... you make me feel so special... so loved and wanted... it's the best feeling in the world you give to me, and i adore feeling this way... i can't find the words to express how much i care for you, nowadays... it used to be so easy... now everything i write feels so cliche-ridden and poor, that i'm never sure what to say... i just absolutely love and adore you... so much that it hurts... my heart aches for you, night and day... i can hardly wait to be with you again, my sweetheart...<br><br>speak to you later, my angel...<br><br>*holds you tightly and kisses you passionately*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

i long to see your beautiful smile...
<br><br>hiya gorgeous!<br><br><br>i'm so glad that you came back to find me last night. i stayed on, just incase you did... but i wasn't expecting you to... it was such a wonderful surprise. you're such an angel.<br><br>i've been dreaming and thinking about you again... didn't sleep much... too many nice thoughts rolling around my head... i keep thinking about meeting you at the station... so romantic. i knw i'm in danger of building the entire moment up into something it can never live up to being, but i just can't help thinking about it... i can't stop thinking about you. i miss you so much. no matter how long we spend together each day, i seem to find it more and more difficult to cope with being apart from you. i had another cry earlier... aren't i pathetic? ...i can't seem to control my emotions anymore. i love you so much.<br><br>i hope you had some pleasant dreams last night... maybe about dragging me around london, whilst i act all numb... hehe... that could still be a possibility i suppose... but i doubt it... i'm not a teenager anymore, and so i tend to be able to hide my nervousness in ways that i could never have done when i was very young... of course, i could still just melt instantly... i'm quite sure you'll have an unbelievable effect on me, however it manifests itself... hehe... talking about london again... i'm becoming obsessed... eek!<br><br>i'd love to be able to wake up by your side on this beautiful bright morning... well, it's bright and beautiful here anyhow... maybe i could wake you by slowly kissing you all over... i think you'd rather like that... i know i would. then, as you awake i'd be gazing into your gorgeous blue eyes, smiling warmly... i'd tell you how much i love you and what beautiful things i've been dreaming of... then i'd hold you close, and we'd kiss each other tenderly... and you'd give me a wonderfully wicked grin... and... hehe... i'll let you guess the rest for now.<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again... i'll be waiting for you later, longing for your attention...<br><br>my heart aches for the moment when i feel your tender loving kisses on my lips...<br><br>you are so sweet. my beautiful adorable angel...<br><br>*holds you tight and kisses you passionately*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello sweet angel,<br><br><br>i'm missing you terribly. i couldn't sleep atall last night - thinking about what you said - so i just stayed up and did some work instead. it upsets me to know you are being treated so badly, and knowing that i can do nothing to help... it's so frustrating. i hope you are alright. you deserve only happiness and love in your life. i wish i could hold you tightly and tell you that it's all going to work out fine... whisper in your ear and tell you how much i love you... caress your beautiful red lips with mine, and gaze deeply into your gorgeous blue eyes... you are an absolute angel... and i wish i was with you now.<br><br>i'm glad you liked my message, even if you had to rush to see it. the mailbox thingy should be fixed now... i asked the guy who runs the site, and he fixed it for me... so everything should be working again as usual. please send me a message or an email back, when you get the chance, to let me know what is happening...  i'm desperate to speak to you again... i love you so much... my heart aches for you... i can't stop thinking about you.<br><br>sorry this is so short... i'm finding it difficult to write... i can't find the words.<br><br>awwwwww... i care for you so much it hurts...<br><br>i feel rather dumb about saying this, but i'm really concerned...<br><br>sorry for acting so pathetic...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

yes, i still love you...
<br><br>hiya gorgeous,<br><br><br>what an incredible surprise... two nice long messages from my sweetheart.<br><br>i feel rather embarassed to admit this, but it might make you smile... i woke up on the floor of the toilet about half an hour ago... hahaha! ...i haven't done that for years! ...i obviously thought i was going to be ill, but never was... then ended up curling into a ball in the corner, underneath the loo... one of those 'where the hell am i?' moments! hehe...<br><br>fortunately, the sleep - however long it was - has cleared my head, somewhat, and so i now feel coherent enough to write back to you.<br><br>yesterday was difficult... i was thinking of you constantly... i so wanted to be with you, more than anything else. i understand your dilemma... and i can understand you wanting to stay there a while, whilst you clear any debts you have and become more financially able to be independent... i do understand. the only thing i can't bare, is the thought of you... having to pretend to be nice to someone who has treated you so badly, just for the the sake of this... although i do realise that it may be neccesary. please don't doubt that i will ever stop loving you, and that i couldn't wait for you... you know i do and that i can... it won't be easy... i will need to be in constant contact with you, until we meet... if i let even one day pass without speaking with you, i feel all strange... i can't bare being away from you for long.<br><br>i had an interesting day out. i went with a couple of friends to the lowry, and we had a lot of fun trying-out the rooms with interactive sound and visual elements... we went for a meal afterwards, and i was pining for you, in my heart... when i got back, i checked to see if you replied... but this mailbox thingy still isn't working properly, because it said i had no new messages... and yet... when i decided to check the inbox, there were two gorgeous long notes from you, my angel... but i didn't realise about this, until after my sleep in the toilet. i went over to my sister's flat to keep her company, whist ivan went out with an old friend... she was very tired already, so i didn't stay too long... long enough though to drink an entire bottle of very strange chardonay... which made me feel so icky, afterwards... it was nice though... the cats kept us amused, and we both had a chat about things... nice to do that... i need to do it more often i think.<br><br>omg!!!<br><br>i am missing you so badly!!!<br><br>*pines*<br><br>i can't wait for you to be with me again.<br><br>i want to hold you in my arms and tell you how much i love you... gaze into your adorable blue eyes and kiss you passionately on your delicious red lips... kiss you all over, until you are sore... i want to make love to you all day long, and all night too... you are such a beautiful, warm-hearted and absolutely gorgeous sexy creature... i wish i could be with you all the time, my angel...<br><br>please find me today, or call... if you can...<br><br>i feel i need a proper sleep now... but you could find me/call me later on, if you want me... anytime after midday... i should be awake again, then...<br><br>remember: i will always wait for you, however long anything takes... and i adore and love you, completely.<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much, kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

want to love you forever...
<br><br>hello my angel,<br><br><br>so sorry i missed your phone call last night. i felt really sad when i realised that you had called and i wasn't about. you sounded very disappointed... i'm so sorry... i don't want to upset you... somehow i feel that i have... maybe i'm just being hyper-sensitive... i don't know. i hope that you are okay, really... i wish i could speak with you right now and tell you how i feel... tell you how much i love and adore you... i've been awake most of the night just thinking of you... my heart positively aches for you.<br><br>i'm staring at your picture again... ohhh, you are so gorgeous... awwwwww... i love you so much... i can't get you out of my mind... i can barely describe the effect you have on me... it's such an all-encompassing feeling... i'm so emotional right now... and gazing into your eyes makes me feel incredibly naughty, too... that look of yours is absolutely delicious... it inspires countless dreams and fantasies... *kiss*<br><br>thank you for your adorable email... it was a wonderful surprise to read that this morning... i wish that i hadn't been out so much yesterday... i know you say that i should get on with things, etc... but i missed you so terribly... i lay awake most of last night thinking about you all snuggled up in bed... hopefully you were dreaming of me... hopefully you are happy today... i do hope that you got my text message this morning and that brightened up your morning a little bit... i hope you understand that i spend the majority of my time dreaming and thinking about you... you are always with me, my angel... forever in my thoughts. *hugs*<br><br>i just got your gorgeous little note in the morning post... i like william morris actually... well, i appreciate some of his designs anyway... and i like that print for some reason... thank you so much for finding the time to write to me... it really is beautiful, to be able to read those words in your own writing... and your handwriting is so yummy... i love it... and i love you more, every single day. i can hardly wait to see you. i want to spend countless hours gazing into your gorgeous sparkling blue eyes... you are so beautiful... i could spend an eternity in your arms... and i know that i'll want to.<br><br>it's good to know that you can read my messages once again, and send me your gorgeous words back too... i dusted off my sister's old mobile yesterday, and it kind of works for texting, but not much else... i know, for example, that i can't call out on it for some reason... i'm going to try to put some money into it today... but if it isn't reliable enough i'm going to get a new one... then we can send little messages of love, or tell each other of our desires, whenever we feel the urge... how yummy! *kiss*<br><br>hope to hear from you soon, my sweetheart...<br><br>i miss you so much...<br><br>*warm hugs and passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello beautiful,<br><br><br>thank you for last night... it was really good to talk with you... it made me so happy to hear your gorgeous voice once again... it felt like such a long time since i last heard you speak. you are an absolute sweetheart... i don't know what i'd do without you... you are with me all the time - always in my heart and forever in my thoughts... i dream of you constantly... whenever i think of you i get really emotional... it's such an incredible feeling... it consumes my heart and mind completely... i can barely find the words these days to express just how much you mean to me... i love you so much kim... *kiss*<br><br>you are so sweet... i don't want to make you feel sad... it was so difficult - hearing you cry about things last night - i so wanted to reassure you about everything... but, unfortunately, i think i was pretty useless at the time... i just started getting all weepy too... i wish that i was able to hold you in my arms and tell you that it will all work out fine... i'm sure it will, eventually... i know i cannot ever understand exactly what you are going through... but i think i do understand the way that all these emotions can just keep building up, and feel as if they are taking you over... i too have cried a lot about things recently... but i think it helps to just let it happen sometimes... i'm sure it does you good to release everything once in a while... and i don't mind it atall, my angel... you can say and do anything when you are with me... i'm so glad that you feel able to lay your heart open to me in this way... i just wish i could be there to hold you in my arms whenever you are feeling sad... i just want to make you happy. *hugs*<br><br>i'm so looking forward to hearing from you again, later today... it's been raining here very heavily and now it smells gorgeous outside... i dreamt about taking your hand and running about with you, getting ourselves completely drenched... holding your tightly and kissing your cool wet lips... licking the raindrops from your smooth wet skin... gazing into your beautiful blue eyes and telling you how much i love you... we'd get so wet and freezing cold that we'd need to come indoors and help to keep each other warm and dry... maybe we could snuggle up together on the sofa and kiss each other from head to toe... or maybe we could cuddle up under the sheets together - hold each other close and gaze into each others eyes for hours, whisper beautiful thoughts in our ears, and lick each others bodies dry... mmmmmm! *lick*<br><br>ooh, just been reading your yummy little book... hehe... how adorable...<br><br>awwwwww... i'm missing you so much my sweetheart...<br><br>speak to you again soon...<br><br>*warm tight hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello gorgeous,<br><br><br>i didn't check my email until after i'd sent your text message this morning, i completely forgot that you said you had sent me something last night... oh, what an incredible surprise... i can't explain how it made me feel... my heart definately missed a beat when i read what you had written to me... you are such an angel... you seem to feel all the things that i do, and with such passion too... i often cry when i think of you, and when i read your adorable little messages like that one... it's because i love you so much too... it does seem cruel sometimes that we aren't closer... but i know this is only a matter of time... that's how i manage to reassure myself... it helps to keep me sane if i remember that we can be together soon.<br><br>i'm so glad that you wrote me that message. i can't express just how much it means to me. i know you say that i'm easily pleased, but i really do treasure everything that you send to me... the things you say and the words you write, they touch me deep inside... it seems very important to me that i have these things to keep hold of, until i can actually hold you in my arms and be with you for real... it's how i cope with the situation right now... knowing how much you care for me, it means a lot... i'm so glad i found you... i don't care how difficult this is... i just want us to be together, somehow... sometime... i know that i need you in my life... i don't know what i'd do without you... i can't comprehend ever being without you... i love you so much, my angel.<br><br>oh dear, i do whine on a lot, don't i?<br><br>hehe...<br><br>i can imagine that these notes are becoming terribly repetitive by now... but i really do long for the moment when i can look deep into your gorgeous blue eyes and see them sparkle with such beautiful energy... so full of love and desire... hopefully for me... i can hardly wait to hold you tight and kiss your delicious red lips... feel your warm breath against my skin... make my body shudder with delight at your every touch... lose myself in you... because i'm sure that i will... i know that i will... i want to love you forever... you are so special, my sweetheart... you are with me, constantly... whenever i think of you i get the most incredible shiver rushing through my body... you warm my heart, and feed my imagination... i dream of you all the time.<br><br>awwwwww... i miss you so much... i can't wait to hear your gorgeous voice again...<br><br>you make me feel so alive... and so lucky... i'm so glad we found each other...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

emotional moments...
<br><br>hello beautiful,<br><br><br>i'm so sorry about breaking down last night... i know that's not what you wanted to hear... and i'm sorry if i upset you, i just got really emotional and couldn't control myself... very silly i know... quite pathetic really... but i'm human, and i get just as confused as anyone would... i have so many insecurities and things about myself that i'm unhappy with... it can be quite easy to hit a nerve sometimes... anything that anybody else says to me gets easily shrugged-off, i guess... but you mean so much to me, and i love you so much... the very suggestion that i shouldn't speak to you again hit me very hard... i wasn't expecting it... and i know that i did overreact... but i was really emotional already... i'm just sorry for behaving like such a useless idiot... i should be able to cope with all this a lot better by now.<br><br>it seems like i always have to keep you up each night for hours... and i know i don't intend to make you so tired and late each day... our conversations just keep drifting on well beyond your bed time... maybe you should be more strict about when you are going to sleep... i know you say that you don't ever want to leave me, and you know that i'll always stay with you until you say you need to go... but i often feel guilty for keeping you up so late at night... i'm sure it's not good for you... and i hate the idea of you hurting your beautiful ears, because you talk to me on that phone so much... but i know i don't want to speak with you any less either... i always miss you, when you are gone... i'm not helping much here, am i?<br><br>i love you kim, and all i want from you is your love in return... i don't ask for much... only what you feel you can give back...<br><br>you have my heart, and i adore you completely...<br><br>i'm not sure what i should write now... i don't want to upset you again by being too romantic, or annoy you by being too naughty... i'm not sure what to say... you are such an angel... i feel empty when you aren't around... i just want you in my life, somehow... i just hope that you want me too.<br><br>speak to you later, my sweetheart...<br><br>missing you lots...<br><br>*warm hugs and wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

feeling lost without you...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i've really missed you today...<br><br>i realise that i've become so used to hearing your voice or reading the things you say to me, that even one day without such reassurance leaves me feelling all empty inside... i probably need to find a way of dealing with this, better than i've done so far... i know that at the moment, we can't always be 'together', and therefore i must learn to cope... but i think of you all the time, so it's difficult... and it seems unfair to say these things, because it might make you think that this is really upsetting me or something... but you said that i should always tell you how i feel and not to hide things, so i guess i'm just writing about how i feel right now... i'm sure this mood will pass... you do make me extremely happy... i suppose this just what it's like to 'come down' from such emotionally high moments... i'd forgotton all about how this feels until now...<br><br>sorry that this message is so bad... i should be writing something beautiful and meaningful... but i just feel a little lost today... i should have gone out, as i intended, but i got up too late again... hopeless, aren't i? ...i was laying under my sheets all morning, just dreaming and wondering... it feels like one of those days when all i want to do is hold you close and cuddle you a lot... one of those silent moments... some things just can't be put into words, and the feelings i have today are like that... all i want is a big hug, that's all... daft eh?<br><br>i found that chat from the end of april... when i asked you to call me for the first time... you're right... i was drinking... my typing was absolutely appalling, but i wasn't so drunk that i didn't realise what i was saying... it's obvious that i was really enjoying myself... so happy to be chatting with you... and that i wanted to feel so much closer to you... otherwise i would never have given you my number... hehe... you said you liked me when i was drunk... that i was cute... awwwwww...  you're so sweet... it's hardly surprising that i fell in love with you... you really are so adorable...<br><br>this message is very late now... as i said, i've had trouble writing today... i can't quite find the right words... i just want to hold you in my arms, feel your warm body next to mine, and hear your comforting words... you are such an angel... i wish i was with you now... i'm going to finish some work now... then i'll curl up under my sheets once more, and dream of you again...<br><br>*big warm hugs*<br><br>awwwwww... i miss you so much, my baby... please write, if you can...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again...<br><br>*holds you tight and never wants to let go*<br><br>*passionate wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello baby,<br><br><br>here's a bit of that message i wasn't going to send... it didn't sound right, but i know you said that i should always tell you how i feel... so i kept some of it for you to read...<br><br><br>i'm missing you so much... i realise that it's only been one day, but it seems like a week or more... i feel so lonely without your kind words, your gorgeous laughter and beautiful thoughts... i'm so pathetic, aren't i? i should be able to deal with this by now, but i still haven't learnt how to... when we are 'together' i feel so happy... as soon as we are 'apart', i suddenly get so low... how silly of me to say such things... i know that i should have something better to write, than all that nonsense... sorry...<br><br>i hope that you are okay... that things aren't too bad there at the moment... you seemed really upset, the last time we spoke... it hurts me to know that you are feeling ill, as a result of the things that are being said to you... i don't like the idea of you having to cope with all that by yourself... it's just so cruel and unfair, that someone as wonderful as you has to put up with such crap... i really wish i could be with you now... kiss you passionately and hold you tightly in my arms... i love you so much, my angel... i think about you constantly... you are always with me, deep within my heart...  *kiss*<br><br><br>okay... that's from yesterday... since then i've had another gorgeous phone call from my sweetheart... awwwwww... you sounded so gorgeous... making a sneaky call in the school yard at break time... how sweet of you... adorable creature... that made me really happy, my angel... you sounded great, but i know now that you were masking a lot of your worries at the time... *hugs*<br><br>it was good to get to chat with you later on... ohhh... sweetheart... if only i could do something to help you more... i know you said that i made you feel a little better, after chatting with me... but i wish i could do so much more... i really do... i must admit that the idea of going to oxford without you, upsets me quite a bit... but i know you have such a lot to deal with... so i will understand if you can't go... awwwwww... feeling sad again now... i would be so lonely there, without you... maybe i shouldn't go either...<br><br>ohhh... you are so gorgeous... i'm looking at your picture again... i hope you really do like me... because i adore you, my baby...<br>june 30 - it's going to be the most important day of the year for me... and i'm starting to get nervous already...<br><br>thanks for talking with me afterwards too, that was so sweet... even if we got cut off at the end... that was unfortunate... i wish that i'd been able to tell you how much i love you, before you had to go... you have such an incredible voice... it really does have an effect on me... like a warm, comforting glow - rushing through my entire body... sending gorgeous shivers down my spine... and making my heart beat faster... very unusual... but extremely pleasurable too... awwwwww... i love you so much, my baby... *kiss*<br><br>i want you so badly... and i miss you so much...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again, my angel...<br><br>*holds you tightly and kisses you passionately*<br><br><br>i love you kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>sorry i didn't write anything yesterday, i just couldn't seem to put anything into words without it sounding stupid... i have been finding it difficult to express my feelings lately... i'm so in love with you, my angel... words just don't seem to fully describe what i feel for you... all i want to do is hold you, kiss you and touch you... for hours... days... weeks... months... years... for however long you'll let me... my feelings for you are so strong nowadays, i get so excited when i hear from you... especially when i can hear your voice... that - at the moment - gives me the most incredible reaction... your voice is incredible... i can't describe what that does for me... and the things you say to me... you are so gorgeous... awwwwww... *kiss*<br><br>it is heavenly to chat with you... even though it's only words on a screen... it's still beautiful... i love reading the things you say to me... and all your delicious, filthy thoughts... you have the ability to get me very worked-up with only a few carefully constructed sentances... hehe... i'm bad... when you write to me, even if it's only a few words, i feel so incredibly happy... i feel your presence always... as if i could close my eyes, and reach out to touch you... i get so close to you... and yet, we've never even 'met' in the real world... although, this will happen soon... then we will know for sure... *hugs*<br><br>all i do know, is that if you still love me - once we've actually met in london - i know i will be yours forever... because i really do adore you kim... i dream about you constantly... you have touched my heart so deeply, and now i never want you to let go... you've made me happier than i've been for a long time... to know that we can be together (possibly), fills me with such joy that i simply can't describe the feeling... it's an emotional rush... a physical and mental reaction, that's so overpowering... i need to just close my eyes and wait.... wait for the feelings to wash through me, before i can even think straight again...<br><br>it was so great to hear you speak to me yesterday... i love your sneaky little phone calls... you always sound so happy and full of energy... i absolutely adore it... you make me feel very special... to call me during the few moments you have at work, just to tell me how much you care... awww... that's so sweet... oh, i love you so much kim...  *kiss*<br><br>so much fun to chat with you later too... twice even!<br><br>hehe... sorry for tearing you away from your work... i know you said that you were only looking for distractions, and that i was far more interesting... but i'm sure it must have been something you really wanted to get done... and then i come and hassle you... oh, how rude of me... anyhow... it was gorgeous, as always... you always make me laugh such a lot... get me feeling very naughty... and make my heart melt with your adorable, sweet thoughts... tonight, i really did want to go to bed with you... desperately... i want you badly... i get very nervous when you go nowadays... because i know i'm going to feel so lonely without you... i wish i could be with you all day and night... i really do... being silly, aren't i? ...i know this can't happen, not really, but i live in hope that one day it might happen. *hugs*<br><br>i should go to sleep now... i'm extremely tired... i was going to go when you did, but i didn't want to leave you without another message again... i will write you another in the morning, when i get up... i'll try to, anyhow... i'm not going to read this one, because i'll just start finding things wrong with it - as i always do... so, please excuse any typing errors... i didn't check for them... *kiss*<br><br>missing you so much, my angel... going to dream about you now... get all snug and warm, under my sheets... and think about what it's like to have you laying next to me...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you again... happily, i know it won't be long this time...<br><br>*big warm hugs and delicious wet kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

such a sweet thought...
<br><br>hello beautiful,<br><br><br>i'm really happy now, because you called me not just once, but three times... and each time you sounded absolutely adorable... such an angel... *hugs*<br><br>i'm glad that you decided to go out and meet karen, after all... she sounds really nice and lots of fun... i only wish that i could have been there too... you both sounded like you were really enjoying yourselves... did you spend all the time chatting about me, or did you find time to talk about something else too? oh dear... that sounded rather arrogant didn't it? hehe... actually, you said that you'd been mostly talking about me... that's so sweet of you... i'm sure you didn't bore her atall... she's always been so happy for us both - whenever i've chatted with her online - always wishing us the best...<br><br>you said that i kept going quiet, when i was with you... but that i was chatting fine with karen... well, baby... it's because i love you so much, that's why... i keep getting these moments of feeling: 'oh i wish i could just hold you in my arms right now and kiss you...', that's why i go quiet occasionally... you have such an incredible effect on me... i'm sure you must realise this by now... i only have to hear your gorgeous voice and i'm in a dream... i just want to be with you so badly sometimes that it really chokes me up, and then i can hardly speak...<br><br>awwwwww... you are so wonderful kim... i've just put the phone down... that was so sweet... being able to talk with you, as you made your way home... i felt as if i was almost there with you... and i really wish that i was too... holding you close and gazing deep into your beautiful blue eyes... delicious, passionate kisses on the train back to romford... how incredibly yummy... *kiss*<br><br>so, tomorrow i book my tickets for london... to come down and see you for the day... i'm so excited, already... i haven't felt quite like this for a very long time... such anticipation... only twelve days away... even i'm counting down, now... every time i think about it, i get a shiver down my spine... it's such a yummy feeling, knowing that i'm really going to be with you so soon... i'm sure, as you said, that i'll start to get really nervous on the day... and that won't really wear off until we've actually met... i know that all i want to do is hold you in my arms and hug you tightly... i'll want to do that for quite a while i expect... i've been waiting so long for that feeling... then, of course, i'll want to kiss you... kiss you tenderly on your delicious shiny red lips... and gaze again into those incredible blue eyes of yours... i know you say that i'm very easily pleased, but that moment will make me the happiest man alive... *hugs*<br><br>it's only minutes since we spoke, but already i miss you terribly...<br><br>i can't wait to hear from you tomorrow, my angel...<br><br>*warm hugs and passionate kisses*<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

i am a very bad boy...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i've been a very bad boy... i haven't written you one of these messages for an entire week... how rude of me... so i shall try to write every day from now on.  *kiss*<br><br>it was so good to be able to speak with you again last night... every moment i can spend with you is incredibly precious... i sometimes feel that i waste it terribly by going so quiet on you... but i often do feel really happy and yet cannot find the words to express exactly what is in my heart... just being able to talk about anything to you is difficult at times, but this is my own fault and has absolutely nothing to do with anything you say or do... it's just me... being daft...  *smiles*<br><br>in only 5 days we'll be together in london... probably still walking around right now, holding hands... gazing into each others eyes... i hope we are anyway... it'd be ever so beautiful to realise a dream or two on that day... we've waited such a long time to meet each other... it seems like i've known you for a very long time, and yet it's been barely two and a half months. it'll be so exciting to be with you at last... i know that i'm going to adore you even more than i already do... i'm sure that i'll only have to take one look into your beautiful blue eyes, and my heart will begin to pound like crazy... i know that i'll be so incredibly nervous until i know how you feel about me... whether you really want me or not... i hope that you do want me... i love you so much, my angel...  *hugs*<br><br>you are so adorable... last night was gorgeous... i love being in bed with you... hehe... you sound so delicious when you talk to me in there, for some reason... and calling me at lunchtime was so sweet, as ever... you always make me feel so special, so loved and very happy... i really do feel that we were made for each other, my baby... it's uncanny the amount of things we have in common... quite unusual really... but ever so nice too.  *kiss*<br><br>it's nice to know that you are interested in what i do... i wasn't sure if you were or not... but you had such a beautiful way of putting it... something like 'of course i'm interested... it's part of you, isn't it... i'm bound to be interested'... that made me go really funny inside... i get incredibly insecure about things... not just myself, but also the things i do... i'm very self-critical... it's nice to know that others think something of me, and what i do... it gives me hope... and you always give me so much hope... *kiss*<br><br>i'll write you something else later tonight, my angel...<br><br>i miss you so much... can't wait to hear from you again...<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br>

i must be punished...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i'm so sorry... i missed both your calls this lunchtime... i've been kicking myself ever since...<br><br>i overslept very badly today... i spent the night in my sister's old room, because mine was far too hot and stuffy last night to sleep in... i can't open the windows in here because the air outside just makes me sneeze and get all irritable... so i have to make do with a large fan instead... but anyway, because of feeling so crap and everything, i couldn't sleep for ages last night... then i went and slept through my alarm... i didn't wake up until  about 12.30... of course, then i panic... i came and checked to see if you'd called already, and you had... i checked my mobile and got your message from early morning... so i sat for a while, feeling sad and stupid... then i decide that you probably won't be able to call me again... so i went and had a shower... then i came back and i checked my mobile again... and realised that you'd tried to call me again... when i was in the shower... awwwwww... and i realise that i can't send you a message back... and so i just sit down and cry... i really am useless sometimes...<br><br>i'd hate for you to think that i don't want to talk with you, or hear from you... that's the very last thing i want... i'm so sorry my angel... i really do miss you too... so badly... it hurts to know that i missed your calls, and that i made you feel sad... i wish i could speak to you now, ever so much...<br><br>i hope i hear from you soon baby... and that you still want to talk with me...<br><br>sorry this message is awful too, but it's the only way i can think of contacting you at this moment...<br><br>i miss you terribly, my beautiful angel...<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br><br>i love you so much kim.<br><br>

i'm far too sensitive for my own good...
<br><br>hello sweetheart,<br><br><br>i'm writing you this message, in the vain hope that you might check your inbox... or even be able to check it... because i'm sure that right now there is no other safe way of contacting you...<br><br>are you okay, my angel? is everything alright there?<br><br>i'm sorry for irritating you at oxford, it's the very last thing i wanted to do... but i just found it really difficult to pretend i was a vitual stranger, when i feel so close to you... and you looked so beautiful... i felt rather numb, not being able to be closer to you, or tell you what i was feeling... and you definately do not look awful in the morning, or even when we got drenched with rain... you still looked gorgeous... your yummy blue eyes are always sparkling and bright... they make me feel something indescribable, deep inside... you make me feel alive...<br><br>i hope you aren't really angry with me... i tried to just fit in, but failed unfortunately... i've become really nervous and insecure since leaving, and i'm scared that you won't want to speak to me - even if you can... i feel like i really let you down, and i wish i hadn't... i actually wish that i hadn't gone there now... i felt that i was in the way... just another 'problem'  that you had to cope with...<br><br>i didn't arrive there in the best of moods... i went in a pub before going into the park and had a few drinks... but when i went to the toilet - and freshened up - i had a massive nose bleed, that took me almost an hour to stop... i was rather fed up after that, and didn't feel atall well... karen stayed with me for a while in the park... but because she was in the enclosure at the front of the stage, she had to leave to go back and keep her place... so i spent a couple of hours or more there, completely alone...<br><br>when you told me what had happened that morning at home, i felt my heart sink... i knew it was the last thing you needed right then... yet another confrontation/ultimatum... and when you said that you might have to stay at home - rather than go and stay elsewhere until the sale had gone through - i realised that things were going to get really awkward for you again... all the space you'd had in the previous week - and your calm and happy state of mind, that i witnessed in london - would be tested yet again... and i knew that it would make the possibilty of hearing from you, or even coming to see you again, incredibly difficult... so i felt really down... and i wanted to comfort you or say something to help you feel better... but i realised that i couldn't say a thing... i didn't know what i could or couldn't say in front of dan... so i ended up going really quiet, and just agreeing with what was already being said... i felt a bit lost...<br><br>i should have been able to cope with this better, but a combination of things made it seem really hopeless... i was seeing everything in a bad light... i felt incredibly insecure and paranoid... i thought you probably wanted me to just piss off and leave you both... but you seemed to want me to follow you around still... i don't know if this was because you did want me there, or were just concerned about me... i probably took everything the wrong way... the more you asked me if i was okay, or what was wrong... the more quiet and awkward i felt... it was abit like those really awkward moments in london, but without a way to resolve what was rolling about inside my head... i stopped looking at you eventually, because i knew i'd just breakdown if you asked me what was wrong again... during radiohead, later on, i was ready to walk off when you said i was really annoying... i was making you angry, and i could hardly speak anymore... i was convinced that i'd fucked everything up, and that you'd never want to hear from me again...<br><br>i was getting really upset by that point... i couldn't believe it when you offered me the chance to stay in your room... i was sure that you just wanted me to leave you both alone... although, i guess you were concerned about what happened to me... i felt it was quite appropriate to hear "i'm not here, this isn't happening", as the rain began to soak us to the skin... and why they chose to play 'creep' last, i'm not sure... but that's exactly how i felt right at that moment... like i just didn't belong there atall... i'm incredibly sensitive, just like you - as you've said before - and so i guess anything awkward was going to be difficult for me to deal with... but i did an even worse job of it than even i thought i would...<br><br>you seemed very self-conscious when we were in the room together... i tried not to stare at you... but you know how i think you are always beautiful, gorgeous and completely adorable, however you look... i'm glad that we still managed to exchange a few warm smiles and glances, that helped me feel a lot better about the situation... i didn't sleep much, although i did get some... everything was still rolling about my head, and i didn't know what to do or say to make things better... when you were getting ready in the morning, you seemed really irritated that i was still there... when i was leaving - and you were getting ready for breakfast - i wanted to say something, to tell you that you looked fine... or ask you to call me, or something... i don't know what was running through my mind at that point... but you really got annoyed with me, and just told me to stop hanging about and go... so i left... i walked back out into the rain... feeling really torn-up inside... as if i'd just lost everything that's precious and special to me...<br><br>kim, i love you... and i'm not sure what you feel about me... i could just be overeacting really badly to what happened... anyway, you probably have much more important things to worry about right now... but please will you try to just call for a few seconds or send a message or something... i want to know if you hate me or not... every moment we have spent 'together' in the past few months, has made me feel more happy and loved than i've been for a very long time... you make me feel so special... and meeting you in london was just pure bliss... i hope that you still feel these strong emotions towards me, and that i haven't just messed everything up... i don't know what i've done, but right now i feel like i'm to blame for all this going wrong... i'm sure i am... and i know that i can't just pick up the phone and call you... so i'm stuck here, wondering if you'll ever speak to me - or see me - ever again...<br><br>i miss you so much, my angel... i hope i hear from you soon...<br><br>*big warm hugs and kisses*<br><br><br>i love you kim<br><br><br>x x x x x x x x x<br><br>

kim, please read...
<br><br>kim,<br><br><br>i'm not sure if you check here anymore to see if you have any messages or not. i know that i can't send you an email, or phone you, so this is now my only way of attempting to contact you.<br><br>sorry... i'm really upset, so this message might sound very strange...<br><br>what's wrong?<br><br>you said you'd call me, but you didn't... i've tried sending you a few text messages since, but you still didn't call or reply... i saw you on the board - earlier today - chatting to karen and a few others... you didn't ask for me... but i was there...<br><br>i'm assuming - from what you said to karen - that you never want to speak to me again...<br><br>i don't understand exactly what i've done to make you want to ignore me... i knew you needed some space - and that you wouldn't be in touch every day - but i never thought that you'd just cut me off completely... i remember that you asked me about this before you stopped calling me - about if i would cope with us just being friends... and i said that i'd have to cope, somehow... but that i'd only manage this if you kept in touch with me, and if we could still be really close friends...<br><br>i may be completely wrong and totally insecure and paranoid right now, but i just can't think of any other reason why you'd never contact me... unless it was deliberate...  :-(<br><br>i'm sorry if i am wrong, but this silence is killing me...<br><br>i'm quite sure now that this is a decision you made before last speaking to me... but i don't understand what i've done to annoy you so much... i know that something had definately changed when i met you at oxford... i know you said that paul had come home early that morning and upset you... my ill health was making me feel shit... and there was an uneasy atmosphere, because i didn't have a clue what i could say in front of your nephew... but i knew there was something else wrong... and when you didn't contact me after oxford i assumed that it was all my fault... and that you'd never speak to me again...<br><br>somehow, you seemed to completely change your mind about me - for whatever reason, i'm not really sure - i guess there must be something dreadfully wrong with me... something really awful... but when we last spoke, you said that you still loved me, that you wanted me to remain your friend, that you'd call me again after the weekend and would stay in touch... that was almost two weeks ago... since then, i haven't heard a thing...<br><br>i know that paul is living there again, and is probably trying to treat you all really well... maybe you haven't had a chance to contact me... i'm guessing that this complete contradiction of what you said to me before, is because you just couldn't deal with the tension anymore... i know you said you were ill again... maybe i'm missing something... but you told me that you couldn't bare having him near you - that he was driving you insane - and that your son couldn't stand him being about the place... i just don't understand why this is suddenly all acceptable now...<br><br>i thought you wanted to get out of that situation?<br><br>i also thought that you loved me... when you kissed me, and held me tight, i thought you really meant it... i thought that, for once in my life, my luck had changed...  :-(<br><br>i didn't want to 'hassle' you on the board today, because i don't want to make you feel more awkward than i already have... but i am getting desperate to speak to you now...<br><br>i noticed that you said you don't have aim anymore... i can't email you... you aren't replying to my text messages... and i promised that i would never phone you at home...<br><br>so, that's it... i'm completely fucked...<br><br>all i've been able to do is just wait... and wait... and wait...<br><br>i can't think straight... i just wanted to discuss things with you, and find out what was wrong... you said that you weren't pissed off with me... but i'm assuming from what i read on the board earlier, that you actually are completely fed up with me...<br><br>i don't understand why... i thought that you cared about me?<br><br>i love you kim, i really care about you and i only want you to be happy... i've always been there for you, whenever you wanted me... i've always done whatever you asked of me... but i can't cope with this deadly silence... i don't know what i'm meant to do... it's tearing me up inside...<br><br>am i wrong? do you still want us to be friends? do you intend to stay in touch with me? do you still want to see me again?<br><br>or is this it?<br><br>just a deafening silence... forever...<br><br>i hope i'm wrong kim... and i hope you don't think badly of me for writing this rubbish... i've only ever wanted to make you happy... i just wish i knew what you think of me, and why you haven't got in touch with me...<br><br>surely you must understand what this is doing to me? ...you know how sensitive i am to this kind of thing... it's fucking heartbreaking... i feel as if you've abandoned me, when i really need a friend... you've just vanished... and i don't know what to do...<br><br>am i really that bad, that you want nothing to do with me anymore?<br><br>you said that you were going to florida for two weeks, at the beginning of august... i'm just hoping that you'll reply to me before then... please will you reply?<br><br>would you be prepared to write to me, for the time being, via this mailbox?<br><br>i can't stand the thought of losing you now... that i'll never see you, or hear from you again... i really can't cope with that... you mean far too much to me, and we've shared too much for everything to simply die like this... i just wish you'd contact me somehow...<br><br>i guess i must be really stupid, to think that someone as beautiful, gorgeous, and so unique as you would have ever been interested in me... i must be a complete idiot...<br><br>*cries heart out*  :-(<br><br><br>gordon.<br><br><br>:'-(<br><br>
