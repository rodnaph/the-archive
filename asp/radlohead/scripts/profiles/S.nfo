I used to have lon ass dreadlocks, so if you see someone on our site with dreads-thats me about two years ago. I went to school for three yrs <br />as a jazz commercial performance major but dropped out once the band got going.Oh yeah I play drums. Lessee what else....... <br />I rock at crossword puzzles and I paly in a side proect called big in japan, that plays all improvised live drum and bass. <br />I am obviously a huge radiohead fan, but I also like-coltrane, elvn jones, nirvana, pixies nick drake, amon tobin, luke vibert, aphex twin <br />thelonius monk, larry young, wayne shorter, godspeed you black emporer, old medeski martin and wood, all the native tongues, clutch <br />bad brains, circle jerks, etc. Blah blah blah-I dunno if you want to know anything else don't hesitate to ask. for tour dates <br />and such just go to laketrout.com I love you all...... really.<br /><br />likes Jesus, RH, REM, Lord of the Rings, the Matrix, Last of the Mohicans, traveling ANYWHERE, new people, new things, new music, playing guitar, daydreaming, laughing, making people laugh, italian & mediterranean food, Jerusalem, seeing Radiohead live in Arles and Frejus, being a chameleon, road trips, okay can't come up with anything else creative to try to tell you who i am. if u want to know, chat with me on rhmb (i can be shy on there) or e-mail me and i'd love to talk ;) <br /><br />Hey don't have much to say at the moment , only im a friend of Punk Floyd (she told me to say that) <br /><br />I'm blackstar..also known as eva..also known as intramoenia..and im still drunk..still punk..still junkie..still unhappy..still crazy..<br />still wild..still scared..still sad..still falling..still crawling..<br />How i'd ever end up here?<br /><br /><br />"when you are certian, it is certian that you have put limitations on you mind." -Alister Crowly<br /><br />Thom, thank you for taking the time to write to me. xxxx <br />Also people, keep your eyes open for the Radiohead Mini of mine buzzing about with the blinking bears on it...Beep if you see me. <br /><br />shauneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! <br />and um... here, sheep! *feeds you chocolate ice cream* <br />LEAVE ME A MESSAGE <br />that isn't my web page. it is shaun's. he says it is empty but i think it is coming along very well. there is beautiful artwork and soon there will be more. you will also find me there. <br /><br />"in the winter i'm a buddhist; in the summer i'm a nudist" <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />a friend of mine sent me a quote once and it's really <br />changed the way i look at living. so i thought i should <br />pass it on to others and make them feel happy...as i am, <br />as he has made me. maybe i'm just being sentimental or <br />maybe i'm just listening to nick drake <br />too much. well, here it is: <br /><br />"Our worst fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. <br /><br />It is our Light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, "Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?" Actually, who are you not to be. <br /><br />You are a child of God; your playing small doesn't serve the world. There is nothing enlightening about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. <br /><br />We were born to make manifest the glory of God/the Divine within us. It is not in just some of us. It is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. <br /><br />As we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others." <br /><br />Nelson Mandela <br /><br /><br /><br />oh and leave me a message....i love messages!!! <br />and i will love you forever if you leave me one. <br />thanks. by the way...hi to alex...cause he's the only one that i know who looks at these profiles. *mwah* <br /><br />welcome one and all.my name is jay and i welcome you to my profile. thank you for looking at me. my low self esteem has now been boosted because i now know wthat someone cares. thank you so very much. we are accepting donations for the get jays ass to europe fun,if you would like to contribute please send a check to jay kraft, 29 frdricks drive lake katrine ny 12449. thank you. im about 5'9 brown hair and devilish good looks. i play guitar and write alot of things. i sing too, not very well but i try. ok i think im done rambling. god bless and carry on. <br /><br /><br /><br />names a-b. more to come. you people are fucking wretched. please, please dont ever forget it.<br /><br />

bands: Radiohead, Travis, Remy Zero, Foo Fighters, Tori Amos, <br /><br />who i am: i am the quiet girl who sits in the back of the classroom, too self conscious to say a word, but smiles politely when a smile is needed. a dreamer.<br /><br />what i've learned from the rhmb: <br />1. goldfrapp, arab strap, sigur ros, jj72.<br />2. people here can be nice, people here can be mean, but if you ever need the band name and only know two words of one song, they are the ones who know. :)<br />3. lovely people exist even though we don't always see them.<br /><br />Random musings: <br />I wish I were in a band. Like a permanent one. Its so cool to play music (not my own even, but cover songs) in front of people. I think it's the only time where I feel proud enough/ courageous enough to stand up and talk aloud. Silence is what plagues me otherwise...<br /><br />I've only recently started venturing onto the Radiohead MB. I started visiting around the time Fran came over from the travis board to chat on the rhmb. Everyone was being pretty snippy with him though...which i resented. No one was showing Fran any hospitality, which they should have. Especially since both bands share Nigel :o)<br /><br />But I've learned that there are some cool rhmb posters here and I'm glad that I get to talk/listen to them.<br /><br />I dunno what else to say here. Hello *waves* <br /><br />--Edited 1.6.02-- eek, some of what i wrote last year on this thing is pretty stupid. But, I've decided to keep it for some odd reason. Why? Dunno, maybe so that i see how or if i've changed as the days fly by. hmm. perhaps...<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
