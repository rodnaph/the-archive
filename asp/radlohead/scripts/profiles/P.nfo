Angelus Narcissusai the Nostalgic.<br />Singer, Poet, Jr. Psychologist.<br />Collects sunglasses and bumper stickers.<br />Has been called cold and heartless.<br />Has been called warm and loving.<br />Has been told she has an amazing mind.<br />Has been told she has a beautiful soul.<br />Is also called things like: perfectionist, control freak, poser, loser, slacker, worthless, directionless, obsessive, clingy, paranoid, hysterical, insane, depressed, and "Palmer" (the worst insult of all).<br /><br />Dreams of meditating on a tour bus and selling sounds.<br />Dreams of healing the world.<br />Dreams of being in a pair of strong arms.<br /><br />Once you get to know me you'll turn away and run.<br />I can guarantee that.
