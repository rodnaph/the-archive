Okay. Radiohead, yeah, they're nice. But anyone looked at the art work on Amnesiac recently? It's scary. It's damn scary. Yeah, so can I start a campain? You know, to get Stanley Donwood on Prozac. That way when my mom walks in and sees the CD artwork thing in the ground she won't be like: 'What the hell is it?!" And I'm all like: "DEAR GOD, MOM! I DON'T KNOW TOO!" It's just liek there. So, I was thinking. Yeah, maybe. That it would be a good idea..for...erm people to talk more. MEAN RADIOHEAD FANS SUCK. They suck more than mean people. Take for instance I'm going to the Houston gig and while I was waiting in line I was bouncing about hyper as hella s usual tryign to talk to these people. And damn, they were unfriendly. That's right. Everyone go hug themselves. I'm sick of you RH fans trying to act all posh by wlaking around thinking it's not cool to not smile. That's gothic for crying out loud. Gothic, man. And that's more trendy than GAP these days. So everyone, you know, be nice. Smile and wave. And dance a lot too. DANCE LIKE KEVIN BACON IN FOOT LOOSE! Because he's got moves. I mean, I think Radiohead would be selling a lot more records if they started getting some little dance numbers down. Like those, erm, Jackson 5 type moves. Hey, that might be cool. And if the music sucks then you watch Thom go off and start singing like Micheal Jackson. Oh yeah, I'll be at the Houston gig by the way. So remember, be nice. And if you aren't a nice person..they Fuck Y'all and Be Happy. :)<br />

another i love from mr donwood<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><b>NEARLY GOT</b><br /><br />One night I am alone in my house, compliling lists of friends from the past. It grows dark, and I begin to wish for company. The list sits before me on the table, reproaching me with intimations of missed opportunities and regretful abandonments. <br />There is a scratching at the window, and absently I open it, assuming that one of my cats is feeling lonely too. To my dismay, a small devil-creature, salivating with anticipation, leaps squatly into the room. I recognise it immediately as being of the type to possess the soul without hesitation. Backing away from its gleaming eyes, I consider my options. With a flash of intelligence, I announce to the devil-creature that it is yesterday, and today I am dead. <br />The creature looks quizzically at me. I insist that it has made an error - it is yesterday, and later this evening I kill myself with a large, sharp kitchen knife. I am dead. My soul has gone. The devil-creature is too late. It looks puzzled, but I explain, with placatory hand movements, that this is really a simple matter. As I am already dead, there is no point in attempting to take my soul. Come back in a week, I tell the devil-creature. The landlord will have re-let the house, and there will be fresh prey. Huffing and puffing, the creature waddles back to the window, and lurches off into the night. <br />Congratulating myself on my quick thinking, I close the window. I sit down once more in front of my list, and it is with a heavy heart that I wander into the kitchen and begin rifling through the knife drawer.<br /><br />xx<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />7474w73w6232<br /><br />good godrich dreams of blood at school and kissing lonesome partners of the same sex pleading for something i'm pretty sure i cannot offer. put a hood over my head smiled like a blushing virgin at the sound of a dirty joke. ran away and hid.<br />xx<br /><br /><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 BGCOLOR="#000000" COLOR="#FFFFFF" LINK="#FF0000" CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0 WIDTH=280><TR><TD><A HREF="http://selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=test01" target="_blank"><IMG SRC="http://members.shaw.ca/stanryker/test01/test01psg1.jpg" WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom></A></P></TD></TR><TR><TD><CENTER><P><A HREF="http://selectsmart.com/FREE/select.php?client=test01" target="_blank"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#FF0000">Which Firearm are you?</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="#FFFFFF"><BR></FONT><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="#FFFFFF">brought to you by</FONT><A HREF="http://www.livejournal.com/users/stanryker/" target="_blank"><FONT SIZE="-2" COLOR="#FF0000"><I>Stan Ryker</I></FONT></A></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><br />

I'm a weirdo.. I'll let my reputation on DA' board speak for itself though... I'm only 15 but its never too early to have good taste in music.. something you should tell to my peers! hhmmmppfff.. lousy teeny bopping, limp dick loving posers! GRRR! Its hard to find a decent conversation with someone my own age but I get by with my friends... my friends are a rare bunch though... Anyway only I don't ever bother searching for people my own age own age.. some of the best conversations I've ever had are with this one 35 yr old women with a kid MY age... <br /><br />If you want to know anything else about me... i.e; a more in depth look at my musical taste then go to the about me section on my page.. it also has pics of me ;)<br /><br />Enjoy! <br />Ed<br /><br />P.S: I love radiohead and radiohead's fans.. a highly cultured bunch of oysters... *Bows..*<br />

i dunno. what do you want? things i like: playing and writing music, soccer, people who can have non-personal arguments, making big plans, travelling (same thing)...<br /><br />things i don't: fish, people who personalise non-personal arguments, people who shirk confrontation, people who muddy waters with illogical statements, refusal to prove an idea, going off at tangents etc., egg-white, and those families who never leave a village and talk in hushed tones about that one who went off to university...<br /><br />i'm at uni at the moment by the way. my family don't all live in the same village though. i have never lived in one place more than 4 years, which i like. both my parents are still alive, which i like. they may die before me, which i am very scared of. i am also scared of my own death, old age, snakes, electricity, and never being able to reunite groups of people from the happiest times of your life.<br />

My favourite word is "crepuscular".<br><br>Chocolate cake goes well with beer, but not in the same glass and NEVER with Fosters.....it's absolute piss.  <br><br>Always spread your Vegemite thinly - it tastes better that way.  Those people who spread it on thick are just weird and cannot be trusted. <br><br>When I was a kid and we had a roast for tea, I'd scrape the marrow out of the bone with a meat skewer and eat it.  I don't do that now.  I also used to get a cup of sugar and dunk carrots in it, crawl around under our house where all the poisonous redback spiders lived and pat lizards.  I don't do any of those things any more......growing up really sucks.<br><br>Oh yeah, I like Radiohead but I like The Go-Betweens even more.<br />
