<h1>Setup Complete!</h1>

<p>The database has now been created and the configuration file written.  The default
user that has been created is called 'admin', and the password is also 'admin'.  This
user has full administration rights and it is <b>HIGHLY</b> reccomended that you change
the password after you have logged in for the first time.  All you need
to do now is click on the following link to start using the Work Manager!</p>

<p><b>NB:</b> You can now make the "config/" directory non-writable to improve security.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
