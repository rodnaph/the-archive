<h2>Smutty Demos</h2>

<p>Want to see some of the stuff Smutty can do without actually getting
your hands dirty doing anything yourself?  You're in the right place.  This
website itself is powered by Smutty, so that's the first demo, hope you
liked it!</p>

<p>All of the demos provide viewable source code so you can see just
how easy Smutty makes it to get things done.</p>
