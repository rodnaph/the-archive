# THE ARCHIVE

This is a for the lulz archive of my old projects I've found from days or yore.
I wrote this stuff pretty much 10-15 years ago in my Uni days, oh the humanity!!!
So keep that in mind if you read it, it's only for my nostalgia.

If I find any more code like this lying around I'll add it here.

No idea if any of it is still executable, let me know if you try it!  Otherwise
just explore the hilarity of my naivity.  :D

## Radlohead

I used to run a Radiohead message board related site called radlohead, it started
off as Perl, and moved to being ASP.  Seemed like a good idea at the time :)

## Skinflowers

I used to help out with some web stuff for the then Skinflowers band, there are
some random scripts and messages boards and stuff.

## JAAB

Just Another Adventure Blog.  A travel blog app I wrote to use to record my travels
when I spent a year exploring the world.  It worked great and when I got home I
printed the whole thing out as a diary/book.

## Smutty

Smutty is a play on words, meant to be a dirty hack around Smarty to make it a little
MVC framework.  I thought the Django admin worked amazingly so wanted something similar
for PHP.

## WMgr

Some kind of work manager app, no idea what state of completeness it's in.

## BeanBuilder

This was my University project.  It's a Java app for plugging beans together in a visual
environment, so you can hook together functionality.  There are some docs I wrote for
the course in there as well.

## Msgboard

Some kind of message board in PHP...  They were all the rage back in the day.
