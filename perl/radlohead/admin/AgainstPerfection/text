Against Perfection
Counseling At The Radiohead Message Board?<br /><br /><br />Opt To Miss Him: <br />Am I the only one here who's NEVER<br />been to a psychiatrist? I mean, I've tried prescription drugs before<br />but my regular doctor gave me those....<br />Perhaps I should make an appointment to see a proper quack, no?<br />I'm curious, am I <br />manic depressive?<br />Borderline Personality?<br />Egomaniac?<br />Schitzophrenic?<br />Pathological?<br />what?<br />hmmmmmm<br /> ¥pensively strokes chin¥<br /><br />Banana:<br />I'm a psychologist and let me give you some advice:<br />1) General practicioners are not qualified to give prescriptions for psychotropic medication (but they do regularly)<br />2) If you're interested in seeing a therapist, look in your yellow pages and ask them if their <br />therapists/counselors come from an APA-accredited<br />program....<br />3) Psychiatrists generally push medication as first line treatments before psychotherapy. So, depending on what you are looking for, you may want to consider whether a psychiatrist or a psychologist would be a better fit for what you are looking for.<br />Hope this helps<br /> <br />Opt To Miss Him:<br />Whoa...sound advice from someone on the RHMB, of all places...<br />I'm interested in being psychoanalized.<br />I want to be emotionally and mentally dissected.<br /><br />Banana:<br />I assume you're American.... but look up in the yellow pages under "psychologists".... and call around and ask for prices, but DEFINITELY make sure that anyone you meet with comes from an <br />APA-APPROVED program otherwise the standard of care you get might be less than sufficient.<br />Ask about their background too....whether they are a counseling psychologist or a clinical psychologist....just basically be a smart consumer about this and I think you'll find something that fits you.<br /><br />Opt To Miss Him:<br />Thank you, you've been very helpful<br /><br />¥warm smile¥<br /><br />Banana:<br />My pleasure.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
