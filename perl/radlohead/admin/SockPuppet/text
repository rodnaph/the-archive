<br> Jan. 8, 2002 - aaaaaawww.. man..... blue links don't work anymore.. like here: <br><br>
this is Jonnys post about beating Grea:  <A HREF="http://www.radiohead.com/msgboard/messages/3848627.html">http://www.radiohead.com/msgboard/messages/3848627.html</A> see it doesn't work <br>but the 6000000th post seems to be working though:<A href="http://www.radiohead.com/msgboard/messages/6000000.html"> 6000000.html</a><br><br>
oh well, it is probably due to the changing of the board that is coming soon. Yes, in case you haven't heard yet, the board will be changing... it has been going through some testing lately at Http://www.radiohead.com/Forum to see what kinks need to be worked out. Some new features will be added to it, such as changing passwords to your names if you wish to do so. and posting will be faster.
<br><br><hr><br>
Nov. 1, 2001 (or sometime around then) - well, i won't be able to work on this page much anymore, so i'm sorry for those of you who like to check here for updates on blues and things... i'll add stuff every now and then... and if you send me things you want to see on here.. i'll put it up. 
also if you want to start your own blue page or something then tell m0ren0... i think.. and he might be able to do something....
