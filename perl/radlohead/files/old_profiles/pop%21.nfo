my momma was a sequencer and my daddy was an 808.
i really like m.a.r.r.s' pump up the volume, so i break out the 45 rpm once in a while.  now i just need a record player.  
somone yelled "new york style" at me the other day.  they seemed really happy about it too.
i meet sages at the bus stop alot.
have a nice day.
