OFFICIAL RHMB BARTENDER
What would you like to drink?
Can I take your order?
No problem, it's on the house!
*mouth on tap*
Don't email. DRINK!
No looking at people. DRINK!
Here you are at the bar. May I take your order?
Sorry if I'm ever mean to anybody on the board.
I'm often quite pissed and aim only to make you the same.
So, *prepares for free drink* , what'll it be?
