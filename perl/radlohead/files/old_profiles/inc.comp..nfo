in '69 my father humped a m-16 through thick steam rice paddies in a land where he found himself illiterate.  these moments ripple out and touch us again and again, long after we've forgotten that first skipped stone tossed aside without thought.  what map has home on it? and i sit now and type these words and know nothing of the smell of a violent body.  but i know this: the way language trips across the tongue, smack of soft flesh on hard, how fingers form words in any medium.  there is no market for these sensations.  at times i sit silent and stroke the air with my thumb, carressing three-d rendered stop-motion letters into being.  this is the way i pass my time.  darling ivory girl, you must be proactive; but frustrated pygmalion cannot find the key to my head.  i dream of fifth avenue at four a.m., with black night in rectangles and the slow wink of streetlights commandeering nothing.  that was the only time i felt it was all possible.
