Radiohead is one of my favorite bands, just behind the cure. I've seen them in Paris the 20-09-2000. this was weird but i loved Idioteque which sounds better live i think. For me their best album is The Bends. I prefer songs like Thinking About You,Lurgee,The Bends,High and Dry,Exit Music,Lucky,Kid A,Idioteque and of course The Thief. Who knows Mogwai and r u still in 2 it or christmas steps?
