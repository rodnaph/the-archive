To be honest, I just wanted to have the last name on the profile list.

And sadly, I failed.  So my existence is now entirely worthless.


Well, okay, I'm not REALLY a blue plastic wristband.  I am merely a blue plastic wristband belonging to someone else.  So maybe I'm that someone else.  Or maybe I'm not.

Well, I'm confused.
