i like television.
i like music.
i like vivid depictions of surreality.
scare me straight.
every thing we do does indeed start a chain reaction.
i dig nick cave and the bad seeds.
and the smiths.
and joy division.
and the cure.
and talking heads.
and other bands too.
im not very fun to talk to.
i warned you.
