Hello All. 

I am Chris and I love rugby and radiohead (the intelligent ones amongst us will realise that both those words start with R....).

I play for Leeds and Yorkshire at rugby and I will be a professional rugby player :)

I'm also in a band (guitar and vocals) and I love writing songs!
