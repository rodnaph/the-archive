Hint No. 2: the photo.<br><br>Vancouver, BC<br><br>October 26<br><br>nic444@hotmail.com<br><br>http://www3.bc.sympatico.ca/Radiohead/trinity.jpg<br>http://<br><br>All you truly need to know: I will ALWAYS be younger, prettier, have more taste, better teeth AND shake a tambourine with far more panache and rhythm than that riot grrrl wannabe Lovepatch, who auditioned for Thonncolphiled by screeching a Bon Jovi "power ballad" from the early 80s. How she got in I'll never know, but I imagine bribery and/or blackmail played a key role. I suppose we need an old member to appeal to the baby boomer demographic. *shrugs* As for the rumour that I'm jealous of Lovepatch's "shaking" ... if I thought that dancing should consist of spastic-like seizures, why then yes! I'd be jealous! :P <br>:#:984835857:#:1

Century Son:#:radiozoom:#:WOMAN!:#:You said to email you sometime.....I'm sure this isn't what you had in mind but I'm at school and I'm BORED (we have net fliters so I can't post on the rhmb OR access my normal email account..) and since I managed to get on this thing, why not? yknow..<br>Ok, lalala, I just emailed Kenny on here, sad I know, but whats the chances he'll ever even CHECK his inbox on here? the only reason he found out about this site is cuz I told him, hmm, and afterall *I* never check my inbox here, when I just did I had 1 message from someone who was applogizing for something they said, and that was early April (though I haven't looked in this thing for months..), anyway the point is I'm going to have to tell you to check this account, balhfkgkdhgk I'm rammbling on aren't I? <br><br>Hmm, so I'm at school in the library, I found out that seniors get out of classes on MAy 22, so I'm pumped, WOOHOO!! ON TO A SHITTY COLLEGE!! CAN'T WAIT!!! I'm peeing myself with excitement right now, errrr.....so how are you? Do you guys have grades (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th..) like Americans do? Fuck, if I plan on studying overseas it might be a good idea to look into this, wouldn't it? I hate to admit this but I am probally too angry/depressed to even function in a college atmosphere, I find myself hating people (not like racists or sexist, but individuals) for what seems to be no reason at all, like on the board there are several people I wouldn't mind if the dropped off the earth entirely (hazey, nari, and several others), sigh, I'm horrible and I know my childhood wasn't as bad as it could of been, in fact it was probally very normal but poor super oversensitive me has fucked herself once again. See this is how it goes, I'll either get there and hate it right away, no time to think..or..I'll get there and act like I LOVE it, like its the best fucking thing to ever happen to me but I'll know its just one big fucking lie, ARGH, I know exactly how I do it, I really do, but I just can't get out of that trap, believe me I have tried I always get in this "I'm going to MAKE things change for the better" persona...yet it never works, even right now I'm thinking to myseld 'this guy doesn't give a shit, why am I writing this...' and yknow what? you don't give a shit, you don't like me, you only talk to me to be nice and I am fucking well awhere of it, and I also know why I'm writing this, it gives me a reason to bitch, I'm at school, I'm bored, you ASKED me to email you, so whynot? <br><br>heh, I hope the school net nanny doesn't filter email messages, I know some schools do, hahaha, watch me get called down to the office for a mental evalution, Mrs Finley....are you reading this? damn..I'm paranoid :P<br><br>I need to take up a hobby or something, like in first grade when we had to write down what our hobbies are for those teacher-student gettingtoknowyou papers, I wrote down "eatting + sleeping" cuz I didn't know what hobby meant *LOL* how sad...<br><br>ummm, whatelse can I say? I already alienated myself from the board, heh, I'm the princess of alienation baybee!!!!! ;)<br><br>its 80 degrees (Farehenight you Austrailian freak..!) hoooooooooot! too bad I'm stuck at school, on a nice day like this I should be at home hiding from the sun and all those creepy "outside" people, lol. DAmn I'm thirsty, why did I skip lunch, oh yes, once again, PEOPLE are in the cafeteria, its another one of my paranoias, can't eat infront of people, though I do just fine in some senarios the cafeteria at school is a nightmare...I wonder if once I get to Kent if it will be the same, I'll be down to a size 2 before Xmas....which would be great if not for the fact I'd have to buy new clothes, I already lost half my wardrobe when I lost all that weight over the summer, I'm even one pants size smaller than all the new clothes that "fit" me are, I have to pig out to keep my stuff, sad...andonce again you don't care...<br><br>I'll shutup now, buhbuy.<br><br>(now you know why I'm friendless...hahahahaha)<br>:#:988041308:#:1
