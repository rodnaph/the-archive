lost my way:#:Mr. David:#::D:#:I doubt you'll ever read this, but I just wanted you to know that you mean more to me than I could ever say.  I wish so much that you could be here, that instead of thinking of you every morning that I wake up, and every evening when I go to sleep, that you could be here in my arms..  I hope that someday that will be true.  I want to hold you, and love you, and kiss you when you're feeling down..  I want to be able to rock you back and forth, kiss you on the forehead, and tell you everything's going to be alright.  Since I can't do that yet, I'll just tell you, everything's going to be alright.  As long as we both stay committed to the path that we both desire, than nothing will be able to stop us! <br><br>I Love you more than words could ever express.. <br><br>David :#:995418147:#:1
