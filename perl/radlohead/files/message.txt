<h2>server problems</h2>

<p>Hey, how's it going?  Well, some of the more regular visitor may have
noticed that the site was down for a few days last week.  We have no idea
exactly why this was, the server was just screwed for a bit, but as you
can see it seems to be back now.</p>

<p>We did have a server change in mind as the site was down, but now it is working
again our plans have been put on the back burner.  We'll just have to see what
happens.</p>

<p>We've also been trying to put some changes into the code side of the side if
your interested, chaning to xhtml.  Exciting stuff... ish...

<p>Nuf for now.</p>
