this is your life and it's ending one minute at a time .i'm not living i'm just killing time . your tiny hands... your crazy kitten smile, just don't leave. i slipped on a litle while lie. ice age coming ice age coming. everything everything in it's right place.<br />i wish i was special. please could you stop the noise.<br />
