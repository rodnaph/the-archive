not a whole of stuff.  if you're sitting around this summer and wonder where i am, i'm doing an internship with the Institute for Bird Populations and don't think I'll have a computer out in the field.  you won't be too heartbroken - the board will still turn ;)  thanks for your interest in me and keep rawkin'
