Budgies, eh...they're one of the cutest things I've ever seen...their little faces, all alert and cheerful.  2 perfect little bright black circles for eyes above a weird little loveheart-shaped beak, which is surprisingly capable of taking a chunk out of your knuckle.  You've got to hand it to them, they're lovely.
