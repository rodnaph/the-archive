Just continue ignoring me.<br><br>I quit my job, so I have nothing much to do except sit here and look at the computer screen most of the day.  I have no friends.  No real friends.  I get the feeling I'm not well liked by most of you.  But, I'm learning to live with it.  <br>Yipee!<br><br>I love you all.  <br><br><br>
