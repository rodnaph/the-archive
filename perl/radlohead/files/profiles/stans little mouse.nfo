hiya...


okay, some stuff about me...

six foot two tall twelve stone deep hazel green eyes...

do not look like thom yorke... well, not much...

like red and yellow a lot... and other colours...


create arty stuff, take polaroids and photopics, make paintings, drawings and do graphic designy things... when i'm not nosing around the bored, seeking inspiration or self-gratification...

sometimes write things down, but they don't make much sense...
