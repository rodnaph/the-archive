Stuff?!? There's so much stuff that it boggles the mind!  Yes. I like the message board...very muchly (yes that can be a word).  I don't often say much though. I just lurk in my spooky depths of the chair and watch.  I'm building an army....wanna join?
	Of course you do.
I'm always interested in hearing from radiohead fans, so if you are really really really bored you can email me. You may even receive a free sample of cereal for your contributions to my email box. 
	I am a pleasant person, happy with radiohead and all that they offer. Ah! refreshing.Goodbye, don't let the door hit ya on the way out.
