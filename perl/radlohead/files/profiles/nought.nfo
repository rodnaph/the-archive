The Personal iD on my custom<br>ZOOM XC USA running shoes was the word "sweatshop."<br>Sweatshop is not:<br>1) another's party's trademark,<br>2) the name of an athlete,<br>3) blank, or<br>4) profanity.<br>I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor of the<br>children that made my shoes. Could you please ship them to me <br>immediately.<br>Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti<br>From: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>To: "'Jonah H. Peretti'" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD Customer,<br>Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have chosen <br>contains,<br>as<br>stated in the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang".<br>If<br>you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new personalization<br>please<br>visit us again at nike.com<br>Thank you, NIKE iD<br>From: "Jonah H. Peretti" <br>To: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD,<br>Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom ZOOM<br>XC USA running shoes. Although I commend you for your prompt customer<br>service, I disagree with the claim that my personal iD was<br>inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's Dictionary, I<br>discovered<br>that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not slang.<br>The<br>word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed for long <br>hours<br>at low wages and under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates from<br>1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your first<br>email.<br>Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about freedom<br>to choose and freedom to express who you are." I share Nike's love of<br>freedom and personal expression. The site also says that "If you want<br>it<br>done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build<br>my own shoes, and my personal iD was offered as a small token of<br>appreciation for the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my<br>vision. I hope that you will value my freedom of expression and<br>reconsider<br>your decision to reject my order.<br>Thank you, Jonah Peretti<br>From: "Personalize, NIKE iD" <br>To: "'Jonah H. Peretti'" <br>Subject: RE: Your NIKE iD order o16468000<br>Dear NIKE iD Customer,<br>Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the NIKE<br>iD web site that "Nike reserves the right to cancel any personal iD<br>up to 24 hours after it has been submitted". In addition, it further<br>explains: "While we honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every<br>one.<br>Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of certain<br>professional sports teams, athletes or celebrities that Nike does not<br>have<br>the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider<br>inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our products.<br>Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to decline personal iDs that<br>may<br>otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you know if<br>we<br>decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to<br>submit another." With these rules in mind, we cannot accept your<br>order as submitted. If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with<br>a new personalization please visit us again at www.nike.com<br>Thank you, NIKE iD<br>From: "Jonah H.

I have<br>decided to order the shoes with a different iD, but I would like to <br>make<br>one<br>small request.
