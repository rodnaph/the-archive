Hello.
I am the person on the RHMB called moswell.
I am also John Leckie. Oh what fun I have,
being an ex-good producer, manically depressed since being dumped
by Radiohead.
I think that Stanley should continue to have a radiantly cheerful outlook on life.
I own no.37 of his book, Slowly Downward.
I.
I.
I.
