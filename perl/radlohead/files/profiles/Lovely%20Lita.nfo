Hi people.
I'm studying high school, I like Rh, The Beatles, Blur, classical music and Joan Manuel Serrat.
I think that probably -because of the situation of the world- in my life I'll first do all the stuff I want to do, and next I will kill myself. 
I'm just scared of that we don't have enough water now.
