I am a carbon-based lifeform living on the planet Earth formerly known as the interstellar genetic soup. My serial number is Etienne Blythe and you can email me <a href="mailto:eblythe@mochamail.com"><b>here</b></a>! My two greatest trips are music and visual art.<br><br>Music: specifically progressive-electro-rock, electronica, rock, indi-rock, folk-rock, techno, drum & bass, ambiant, jazz, classical, ska, house and industrial-rock. I also play afew instruments. Not really excelling in one but more like being an average/less-than-average player for many. I play classical guitar, lead guitar bass/contre-bass, tam-tams, TS404s, vocoders, turntables (scratchers), drum synths, boards (keyboards, piano), and various analog synths. I also have a bit of experience playing real drums but I'm not very good at all.<br><br>Visual art: specifially 3D animation and special effects. I love the challenge of using a surealistic concept and making it as realistic as possible. I also like the idea of sci-fi falling-apart worlds to be pretty cool. other forms of art, drawing (pencil, only b&w), photography, landscape art, interface design. And the occasianal structure made out of toothpicks and marshmellows. ;)<br><br>You can visit my website <a href="http://nearworlds.cjb.net"><b>here</b></a>. It has most of my art up, not counting drawings and most photographs, as I don't have a scanner. I also have some of my soundscapes online, you can listen to my noise <a href="http://www.ampcast.com/droolingampfanclub"><b>here</b></a>!<br><br>RHMB rules, because I meet so many like-minded people there! A few of which would be my closest friends if they would live in town! Well... maybe they are very good friends already! :)
