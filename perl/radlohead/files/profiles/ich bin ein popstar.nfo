one day, when i am famous in my own right, i am going to sing a duet with thom on 'thinking about you!'  

until then i'm just going to frequent the rhmb and defend Pablo Honey vehemently!!!  and i'm also going to defend bono at every conceivable opportunity, because us popstars gotta stick together . . . 

by the way i'm first on the left in the group pic.
