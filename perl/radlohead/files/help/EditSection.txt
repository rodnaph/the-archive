<h2>editing a section</h2>

Editing the pages in your section is fairly simple assuming you are
fairly familiar with HTML.  If this is the case then you basically
enter all the code for the page into the text box provided and then
click <b>SAVE CHANGES</b>.  Remember to always save your changes after
you have made any, if you use any of the other features on the page
after making changes, your changes will NOT be saved.

<p>If you are not familiar with HTML then we strongly advise you to
go and find some help on the web, it's really simple to pick up,
honestly.

<h2>linking pages together</h2>

If you have created more than one page for your section then your going
to want to be able users to navigate between them.  This is done by simply
using the following code:

<xmp>

<link page="PAGE_NAME">LINK_TEXT</link>

</xmp>

<p>The link to the page PAGE_NAME will then be created for you in your pages.
NB. The name of the page is whatever YOU called it, make sure you type it correctly
as otherwise the link will not be created successfully.

<p>The LINK_TEXT part doesn't haev to be plain text, it can be any HTML you
want.  So, if you want an image to be a link, just put an IMG tag there
instead.

<h2>hosting</h2>

At the moment we're afraid we can't provide any hosting for images, etc...  This is
something we are looking into providing in the future.  This means that you will have
to host any images you use elsewhere and link to them. <help>Hosting</help>
