<h2>hosting</h2>

At the moment we are unable to provide hosting for sections/pages
here at radLohead.  This is something that we are looking into though
and we'll make it known if/when it happens.

<p>If you have a profile and just want to have an image for it hosted
here then we are able to do this.  All you need to do is simply email
your image to <a href="mailto:images@radlohead.com">images@radlohead.com</a>
along with your username and we'll put it on the space.  Each user
is only allowed one image though, so if you send us a second image it
will overwite the first.

<p>We'll then get back to you when this is done.  You can then link to
that image with the following url which you will need to enter into
the IMAGE field when editing your profile. <help>EditProfile</help>

<xmp>

http://www.radlohead.com/files/images/profiles/YOUR_USERNAME.EXT

</xmp>

<p>It must be noted that YOUR_USERNAME will have to be as it appears in the
address bar when you view your profile (07.pl).

<p>The .EXT part is the extention and will be whatever type the file was you
sent us (eg, .jpg or .gif).
