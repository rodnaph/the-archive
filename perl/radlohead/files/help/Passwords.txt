<h2>passwords</h2>

Here at radLohead all the features are protected with a username/password system
to help prevent malicious use of the facilities.  We do our best to make this
system work, and for the most part it seems it has.

<p>Password here are <b>case sensitive</b> so when entering your password be sure
that you aren't using the wrong case.

<p>If you forget your password then just get in contact with us at <mail>passwords@radlohead.com</mail>
and we'll send an email to you at the address you entered when you registered the username.
We realise this system is new, so if you registered a username before it was implemented
we'll find some other way to get your password back to you.
